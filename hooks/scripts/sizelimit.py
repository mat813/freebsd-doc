# is the sum of all the transaction files.  If you're here, presumably it means
# you were about to add a large transaction.

# Check your 'svn status' output, think carefully and take extra care.  You may
# temporarily add yourself to /conf/sizelimit.conf once you're in the 'careful'
# frame of mind. :)

# Be sure to remove yourself after you're finished, or you might find yourself
# having to explain a large accident...
