    <p>As management understanding of the Year 2000 problem (aka, "The
      Millennium Bug") increases, more and more companies are demanding
      official statements from the vendors of their hardware and software
      as to how their product will handle the year 2000 date rollover.</p>

    <p>The current FreeBSD statement is as follows:</p>
    
    <blockquote><big>"We believe, but cannot guarantee, that FreeBSD is Y2K
      compliant. We have spent a significant amount of time verifying
      this to be the case, but it is possible that something may have been
      overlooked. If a Y2K bug is found in the future, we will attempt to
      fix it as soon as possible."</big></blockquote>

	FreeBSD project</b></p>

    <p><i>(This section based on the text from the <a
	  href="http://www.linux.org.uk/mbug.html">Linux Y2K compliance
	  page</a>)</i></p>
    
    <p>As with all Unix and Unixlike operating systems, time and dates in
      FreeBSD are represented internally as the number of seconds since the
      1st of January 1970 (the Unix "epoch"). Currently, that figure is stored 
      as a 32 bit integer, and will run out part way through 2038. By then we
      should (hopefully) be using a counter of 64 bits (or greater) which
      should be good until the end of the universe.</p>

    <p>Note that the OS being Y2K compliant will not fix errant
      applications that are not Y2K compliant.</p>

    <p>Note also that the OS expects to read the current date and time from
      the CMOS clock of your computer. Not all of these devices correctly
      handle the year 2000. You are advised to test each platform individually 
      to ensure that your hardware clock behaves correctly when going from
      1999 to 2000, and that it correctly interprets the year 2000 as a leap
      year.</p>

    <h2>Problematic applications</h2>

    <p>This section is currently a placeholder. As we become aware of
      applications that have a Y2K problem we will note them here, and also
      attempt to indicate which versions (if any) of the software are
      fixed.</p>

    <p>If you have further questions about FreeBSD's year 2000 compliance, or
      you have discovered an application running under FreeBSD that is not Y2K 
      compliant, please contact the project at <a
