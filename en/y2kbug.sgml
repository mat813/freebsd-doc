    <p>As management understanding of the Year 2000 problem (aka, "The
      Millennium Bug") increases, more and more companies are demanding
      official statements from the vendors of their hardware and software
      as to how their product will handle the year 2000 date rollover.</p>

    <p>Organizations that use unix and unix like operating systems
      such as FreeBSD are already one step ahead of the problem. FreeBSD
      will properly maintain time long after year 2000 passes.</p>

<h2>Background information</h2>

    <p><i>(This section based on the text from the <a
	  href="http://www.linux.org.uk/mbug.html">Linux Y2K compliance
	  page</a>)</i></p>
    
    <p>As with all Unix and Unixlike operating systems, time and dates in
      FreeBSD are represented internally as the number of seconds since the
      1st of January 1970 (the Unix "epoch"). Currently, that figure is stored 
      as a 32 bit integer, and will run out part way through 2038. By then we
      should (hopefully) be using a counter of 64 bits (or greater) which
      should be good until the end of the universe.</p>

    <p>Note that the OS being Y2K compliant will not fix errant
      applications that are not Y2K compliant.</p>

    <p>Note also that the OS expects to read the current date and time from
      the CMOS clock of your computer. Not all of these devices correctly
      handle the year 2000. You are advised to test each platform individually 
      to ensure that your hardware clock behaves correctly when going from
      1999 to 2000, and that it correctly interprets the year 2000 as a leap
      year.</p>

<h2>What you can do</h2>

      <p>FreeBSD will continue to properly maintain time well into the
      next century. Third party applications, however, might not.
      Your best defense against year 2000 issues is a good
      offense. Listening to stories claiming the coming meltdown of
      the world as we know it are <strong>not</strong> the way to
      solve the millenium bug. Nor is waiting until the last
      minute. The FreeBSD Project recommends that your organization
      apply sound system administration principles as the millenium
      approaches.</p>

      <p>There are tests that you can perform to see how your system will
      respond. Set your clock to a few minutes before midnight on New
      Year's Eve and watch the system time. Your system should display
      the year as 2000 and not 1900. If the year is displayed
      incorrectly, then you will have plenty of time to update your
      hardware. Operating your organizations information systems under
      their normal daily load with the clock set forward can provide
      valuable insight into your vulnerablility to year 2000 issues.</p>

    <h2>FreeBSD Year 2000 Statement</h2>
    
    <blockquote>
     <p>
     "After extensive analysis and testing, we believe that FreeBSD is 100% Y2K
      compliant. In the unlikely event that something has been overlooked, we
      will do our best to fix it as soon as possible."
    </p>

    <h2>Fixed problems</h2>
    
    <p>The following Y2K problems have been identified and fixed in
      FreeBSD.</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><a
	  href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=1380">misc/1380</a></dt>
      <dd>Several programs have a hardcoded 19%d in responses for the year.
	Affected programs include: yacc, ftpd, and make.</dd>

      <dt><a
	  href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=1382">conf/1382</a></dt>
      <dd>The sed script in /etc/rc.local that builds the host/kernel ID line
	for the message of the day relies on the year not going past
	1999.</dd>

      <dt><a
	  href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=3465">misc/3465</a></dt>
      <dd>The etc/namedb/make-localhost command generates the DNS serial
	number as YYMMDD. In the year 2000, this will be generated as
	1YYMMDD.</dd>

      <dt><a
	  href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=4930">gnu/4930</a></dt>
      <dd>groff tmac macros have hardcoded 19 for generating some dates.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h2>Problematic applications</h2>

    <dl>
      <dt><a
	  href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=7681"?ports/7681</a></dt>
      <dd>TkDesk 1.0 uses a hardcoded 19 in the file listing window. A
	file with a date &gt 2000 is displayed with a year looking like
	"191xx" where xx is the last two numbers of the real date.</dd>
    </dl>

      you have discovered an application running under FreeBSD that is not Y2K 
      compliant, please contact the project at <a
