	<p>While #freebsd channels exist on various IRC networks, the FreeBSD
		project does not control them or endorse IRC as a support medium.
	 	You may be ignored, insulted, or kicked out if you ask questions on
		any channel in IRC, though you may have slightly better luck
		in channels named #freebsdhelp where such exist.  If you
	  	want to try these or any other channels on IRC, it is nonetheless
	        at your own risk and any complaints about conduct on those channels
		should not be directed to the FreeBSD project.  See also
		<a href="&base;/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/faq/support.html#IRC">the FAQ entry</a> for
	more information.</p>
