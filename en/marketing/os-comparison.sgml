      There are numerous testimonials of active servers with uptimes
      measured in years.  The new <strong>Soft

      file system optimizes disk I/O for high performance, yet still
      ensures reliability for transaction based applications, such as
      databases.</td>

    <td><img src="../gifs/smiley.png" alt="[Great]">
      Linux is well known for its reliability.  Servers often stay
      up for years.  However, disk I/O is non-synchronous by default,
      which is less reliable for transaction based operations, and can
      produce a corrupted filesystem after a system crash or power
      failure.  But for the average user, Linux is a very dependable
      OS.</td>

    <td><img src="../gifs/frowny.png" alt="[Bad]">
      All Windows users are familiar with the "Blue Screen of
      Death".  Poor reliability is one of the major drawbacks of
      Windows.  Some of the major issues have been fixed in Windows
      XP, but "code bloat" has introduced many more reliability
      problems.  Windows XP uses a lot of system resources and it is
      very difficult to keep the system up for more than a couple of
      months without it reverting to a crawl as memory gets corrupted
      and filesystems fragmented.</td>

    <td class="category">Performance</td>

    <td><img src="../gifs/smiley.png" alt="[Great]">
      FreeBSD is the system of choice for high performance network
      applications.  FreeBSD will outperform other systems when
      running on equivalent hardware.  The largest and busiest public
      server on the Internet at ftp.freesoftware.com, uses FreeBSD to
      serve more than 1.2 terabyte/day of downloads.  FreeBSD is used
      by Yahoo!, Qwest, and many others as their main server OS
      because of its ability to handle heavy network traffic with high
      performance and rock stable reliability.</td>

    <td><img src="../gifs/plain.png" alt="[OK]">
      Linux performs well for most applications, however the
      performance is not so optimal under heavy network load.  The
      network performance of Linux is 20-30% below the capability of
      FreeBSD running on the same hardware.  The situation has
      improved somewhat recently and the 2.4 release of the Linux
      kernel introduced a new virtual memory system based on the same
      concepts as the FreeBSD VM system.  Since both operating systems
      are open source, beneficial technologies are shared and for this
      reason the performance of Linux and FreeBSD is rapidly
      converging.</td>

    <td><img src="../gifs/frowny.png" alt="[Bad]">
      Windows is adequate for routine desktop applications, but it
      is unable to handle heavy network loads.  A few organizations
      try to make it work as an Internet server.  For instance,
      barnesandnoble.com uses Windows NT, as can be verified by the
      error messages that their webserver produces, such as this
      recent example <strong><tt>Error Message: [Microsoft][ODBC SQL
      Server Driver][SQL Server] Can't allocate space for object
      'queryHistory' in database 'web' because the 'default' segment
      is full.</tt></strong>.  For their own "Hotmail" Internet
      servers, Microsoft used FreeBSD for many years.</td>

    <td class="category">Security</td>

    <td><p><img src="../gifs/smiley.png" alt="[Great]">FreeBSD has been the subject
      of a massive auditing project for several years.  All of the
      critical system components have been checked and rechecked for
      security-related errors.  The entire system is open source so
      the security of the system can and has been verified by third
      parties.  A default FreeBSD installation has yet to be affected
      by a single CERT advisory in 2000<small><sup><a
href="#3">3</a></sup></small>.</p>

    <p>FreeBSD also has a notion of kernel security levels, virtual
      server jails, capabilities, ACLs, a very robust packet filtering
      firewall system, and intrusion detection tools.</p></td>

    <td><p><img src="../gifs/frowny.png" alt="[Bad]">The open source nature of
      Linux allows anyone to inspect the security of the code and make
      changes, but in reality the Linux codebase is modified too
      rapidly by inexperienced programmers.  There is no formal code
      review policy and for this reason Linux has been susceptible to
      nearly every Unix-based CERT advisory of the year.  This problem
      is compounded by the fact that distributions like Red Hat tend
      to turn on notoriously insecure services by default.</p>

    <p>However, Linux does include a very robust packet filtering
      firewall system and a competent administrator can remove unsafe
      services.</p></td>

    <td><p><img src="../gifs/frowny.png" alt="[Bad]">Microsoft claims that their
      products are secure, but they offer no guarantee, and their
      software is not available for inspection or peer review.  Since
      Windows is <em>closed source</em> there is no way for users to
      fix or diagnose any of the security compromises that are regularly
      published about Microsoft systems.</p>

    <td class="category">Filesystem</td>

    <td><img src="../gifs/smiley.png" alt="[Great]">FreeBSD uses the Berkeley Fast
      Filesystem, which is a little more complex than Linux's ext2.
      It offers a better way to ensure filesystem data integrity,
      mainly with the "softupdates" option.  This option decreases
      synchronous I/O and increases asynchronous I/O because writes to
      an FFS filesystem aren't synced on a sector basis but according
      to the filesystem structure.  This ensures that the filesystem
      is always coherent between two updates.  The FreeBSD filesystem
      also supports file flags, which can stop a would-be intruder
      dead in his tracks.  There are several flags that you can add to
      a file such as the immutable flag.  The immutable (schg) flag
      won't allow any alteration to the file or directory unless you
      remove it.  Other very handy flags are append only (sappnd),
      cannot delete (sunlnk), and archive (arch).  When you combine
      these with the kernel security level option, you have a nearly
      impenetrable system.</td>

    <td><p><img src="../gifs/frowny.png" alt="[Bad]">The Linux ext2 filesystem gets
      its performance from having an asynchronous mount.  You can
      mount FreeBSD FFS filesystems as asynchronous but this is very
      dangerous and no seasoned Unix administrator would do this.  It
      is amazing that Linux is designed this way by default.  Often a
      hard crash permanently damages a mount.  FreeBSD or Solaris can
      sustain a very hard crash with only minor data loss, and the
      filesystem will be remountable with few problems.</p>

    <p>There are several new journalling filesystems for Linux that
      fix some of these issues.</p></td>

    <td><img src="../gifs/frowny.png" alt="[Bad]">The Microsoft FAT filesystem and
      the newer NTFS are both plagued by over 20 years of backwards
      compatibility with the earliest of PC-based filesystems.  These
      filesystems were not designed for today's demanding server
      applications, they weren't even designed with a multi-user OS or
      networking in mind!</td>

  <tr>
    <td class="category">Device Drivers</td>

    <td><p><img src="../gifs/plain.png" alt="[OK]">The FreeBSD bootloader can load
      binary drivers at boot-time.  This allows third-party driver
      manufacturers to distribute binary-only driver modules that can
      be loaded into any FreeBSD system.  Due to the open-source
      nature of FreeBSD, it is very easy to develop device drivers for
      new hardware.  Unfortunately, most device manufacturers will
      only release binaries for Microsoft operating systems.  This
      means that it can take several months after a hardware device
      hits the market until a native device driver is available.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, FreeBSD also includes full NDIS API compatibility,
      so that binary Windows network device drivers can be loaded into
      the FreeBSD kernel directly.</p>
    </td>

    <td><img src="../gifs/frowny.png" alt="[Bad]">The Linux community intentionally
      makes it difficult for hardware manufacturers to release
      binary-only drivers.  This is meant to encourage hardware
      manufacturers to develop open-source device drivers.
      Unfortunately most vendors have been unwilling to release the
      source for their drivers so it is very difficult for Linux users
      to use vendor supplied drivers at all.</td>

      relationships with hardware vendors.  There are often conflicts
      when using device drivers on different versions of Microsoft

<h2>Filesystem</h2>

<p>FreeBSD uses FFS, the Berkeley Fast File System, with the addition
  of "Soft Updates" for performance and consistency.  FreeBSD
  5.0-CURRENT (the development branch), gives user the ability to
  automatically snapshot file systems, as well as the ability to store
  extended attributes on files, in turn supporting other features such
  as Access Control Lists (ACLs).  A paper title "Journaling Versus
  Soft Updates: Asynchronous Meta-data Protection in File Systems"
  presented at the USENIX 2000 Technical Conference discusses the
  performance and consistency differences between journaled and soft
  updates consistency mechanisms.  This paper is available online from
  <a
  href="http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~gnager/papers/usenix2000.ps">http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~gnager/papers/usenix2000.ps</a>.
  This paper also discusses two different journaling implementations
  based on FFS and developed on FreeBSD.  Clearly, FreeBSD is at the
  forefront of filesystem research and this is the source of many of
  its performance and reliability advantages.</p>

<h2>Performance Benchmarks</h2>

<p>Numerous benchmarks have continued to show FreeBSD's clear
advantage for network performance.  Yahoo!, Xoom.com, Qwest, and some
of our other largest customers have published results showing the
clear case for using FreeBSD in the enterprise.  It's important to
understand that benchmarking is just a game, and that for real
performance comparisons you need to perform real-world test.  However,
it's easy to find published benchmarks on the Internet which show
FreeBSD with a commanding lead over the competition:</p>

<h2>Ports Collection</h2>

<p>Even with all the hyper about open standards, getting a program to
  compile on various Unix platforms can be a tricky task.
  Occasionally, you might be lucky enough to find that the program
  you want compiles cleanly on your system, install everything into
  all the right directories, and run flawlessly "out-of-the-box", but
  this behavior is somewhat rare.  Most of the time, you find yourself
  needing to make modifications in order to get the program to work.
  This is where the FreeBSD Ports Collection comes to the rescue.</p>

<p>The general idea behind the Ports Collection is to eliminate all of
  the messy steps involved with making things work properly so that
  the installation is simple and painless.  With the Ports Collection,
  all of the hard work has already been done for you, and you are able
  to install any of the Ports Collection ports by simply typing 'make
  install'.</p>

<!-- XXX use os.numports entity -->

<p>The Ports Collection provides a makefile skeleton that describes
  where to download the software and how to compile and install it.
  There are currently over 11,500 applications in the FreeBSD
  Ports tree and with a single command the ports mechanism will
  automatically download the software source code, perform a checksum,
  uncompress the software, apply any FreeBSD-specific patches,
  configure the software, run the compilation, install the software,
  and clean up after itself!  Ports can of course depend on other
  ports which are built automatically in the same fashion and binary
  packages can be used as well.  The FreeBSD Ports Collection was
  recognized very early on as an elegant method to deal with a complex
  problem so it's functionality has been shared with the other BSD
  Unix systems and some Linux distributions as well.</p>
