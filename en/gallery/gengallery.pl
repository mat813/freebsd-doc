# gengallery.pl - script to convert tab-delimited gallery db file to
# a section of an SGML list (not a full SGML file!) for inclusion
# into another SGML file where the <UL></UL> list element pair is
# already in existence.
#
# Syntax: gengallery.pl type < galleryfile.db > galleryfile.inc
# where type is one of: commerical, nonprofit, personal
