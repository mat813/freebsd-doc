A Solution to the Metadata Update Problem in File Systems</li>

<li><a name="tcfs" href="http://tcfs.dia.unisa.it/">TCFS</a>
is a Transparent Cryptographic File System that is a suitable
solution to the problem of privacy for distributed file system. By a
deeper integration between the encryption service and the file system,
it results in a complete trasparency of use to the user
applications. Files are stored in encrypted form and are decrypted
before they are read. The encryption/decryption process takes place on
the client machine and thus the encryption/decryption key never
travels on the network.</li>

<li><a name="Tertiary" href="http://now.cs.berkeley.edu/Td/">Tertiary Disk</a>
is a storage system architecture to create large disk storage systems
that avoid the disadvantages of custom built disk arrays. The
name comes from twin goals: to have the cost per megabyte and
capacity of tape libraries and the performance of magnetic
disks. We use commodity, off the shelf components to develop a
scalable, low cost, terabyte capacity disk system. Our target is
to build a complete storage system with about 30-50% extra to
the cost of the raw disk.  Tertiary Disk uses PCs connected by a
switched network to host a large number of disks. Our prototype
consists of 20 200MHz PC PCs, which host 370 8GB disks. The PCs
are connected through a 100Mbps Ethernet switch.</li>

<li><a name="vinum" href="http://www.vinumvm.org/">Vinum</a>

<li><a name="v9fs" href="http://www.acl.lanl.gov/~rminnich/">
V9FS: Memory-based file system for FreeBSD</a> It will (we hope)
become the basis of private name spaces for FreeBSD in the
future. It provides a file system that uses only memory for
directories, inodes, and data.  This is not at all like mfs,
since mfs uses memory for "disk blocks", and essentially acts as
the device for UFS. V9FS in contrast is a first-class citizen
and is a full mountable file system. No writeup yet.</li>

<li><a name="WAFS" href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~stein/wafs/">
WAFS</a> is a simple file system designed to act as a logging
service for kernel subsystems. Reads and writes are keyed
by log-sequence number (LSN). All writes to WAFS are     
sequential. Kernel subsystems can use this LSN service to
enforce write-ahead logging and guarantee consistency.

href="http://www.csua.berkeley.edu/computing/software/lottery-sched.html">
Lottery Scheduling Kernel</a>: This work is based on
Waldspurger's lottery scheduling algorithm, which implements
proportional-share resource management. The primary advantages
are that users have strict control over the relative execution
rates of their processes, and users are load-insulated from each
other, preventing one user from dominating the CPU.</li>

Just because you don't have the time to write the driver
yourself doesn't mean you can't still help. The idea behind
the BSD Driver Database is to help individuals with

<li><a name="atm" href="http://www.ccrc.wustl.edu/pub/chuck/tech/bsdatm/bsdatm.html"> BSD ATM: implementation of ATM internetworking under 4.4BSD</a>:
New computer applications in areas such as multimedia, imaging,
and distributed computing demand high levels of performance from
computer networks. ATM-based networking solutions provide one
possible alternative to meeting these performance needs.
However, the complexity of ATM over traditional networks such as
Ethernet has proven to be a barrier to its being used. In this
paper we present the design and implementation of BSD ATM, a
light-weight and efficient ATM software layer for BSD-based
operating systems that requires minimal changes to the operating
system. BSD ATM can be used both for IP-based networking traffic
and for ``native'' ATM traffic.</li>

protocol currently supported is the BRI protocol.  ISDN4BSD allows you

The OSKit is a framework and a set of 31 component libraries oriented

providing in a modular way not only most of the infrastructure
"grunge" needed by an OS, but also many higher-level components, the
OSKit's goal is to lower the barrier to entry to OS R&amp;D and to
lower its costs. The OSKit makes it vastly easier to create a new OS,
port an existing OS to the x86 (or in the future, to other
architectures supported by the OSkit), or enhance an OS to support a
wider range of devices, file system formats, executable formats, or
network services. The OSKit also works well for constructing OS-related
programs, such as boot loaders or OS-level servers atop a
microkernel.</li>

to provide QoS without the need of modification or recompilation. A
simple API is provided for (new) applications to take addvantage of
the fine-grained QoS support.

Currently, the Eclipse project targets QoS support for server
