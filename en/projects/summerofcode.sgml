<h2>Example Proposal Ideas</h2>

<p>In addition to the student project ideas listed below, the FreeBSD
Project maintains a list of general projects looking for volunteers <a
href="&base;/projects/ideas/index.html">here</a>.</p>

<a name="p-userland"></a>
<h3>Userland / Installation Tools</h3>

<ul>
<!--  <li><strong>FreeBSD website redesign</strong></li> -->
  <li><strong>Integrate BSD Installer</strong>: Prepare a prototype
    merge of the <a href="http://www.bsdinstaller.org/">BSD
    Installer</a> as a complete replacement for the venerable FreeBSD
    sysinstall program.  Enough of the groundwork has been laid out now
    that someone with a few months and some background could do a lot
    of good work here, especially with adequate mentoring by more
    senior FreeBSD developers.</li>

  <li><strong>Bundled PXE Installer</strong>: It would be great to
    have a bundled PXE installer.  This would allow one to boot an
    install server from a FreeSBIE live CDROM on one box, set the BIOS
    on subsequent boxes to PXE boot, and then have the rest happen by
    magic.  This would be very helpful for installing cluster nodes,
    etc.</li>

  <li><strong>Fully Integrated SNMP monitoring</strong>: Plugins for
    our BSNMP pieces to monitor elements of system state such as load,
    disk space, VM statistics, entropy, firewall rules and states,
    sendmail queues and accepts/rejects, and the like.  An SNMP client
    that could pull and centralize the data gathering, render it,
    etc.  <a href="mailto:philip@FreeBSD.org">&a.philip;</a>, <a
    href="mailto:glebius@FreeBSD.org">&a.glebius;</a>, <a
    href="mailto:harti@FreeBSD.org">&a.harti;</a>, and <a
    href="mailto:rwatson@FreeBSD.org">&a.rwatson;</a> are
    coordinating.</li>

  <li><strong>Integrate Xen Support</strong>: Support for the <a
    href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/SRG/netos/xen/">Xen virtual
    machine monitor</a> is coming into FreeBSD -CURRENT, so the
    installer could be updated to make it possible to setup a Xen
    system with several FreeBSD nodes, etc.</li>

  <li><strong>Improve our regression testing system</strong>: Nik
    Clayton has written a regression test infrastructure using Perl.
    More of the regression tests should be made to work with libtap.
    There are two main parts to it.  First, many of the existing tests
    should be moved from using assert() to using ok() and friends from
    libtap.  Second, more regression tests should be written.
    Students familiar with scripting languages and software testing
    are encouraged to work on this.  <a
    href="mailto:nik@FreeBSD.org">&a.nik;</a> is the coordinator.
</li>

  <li><strong>Tracking performance over time</strong>: One of the major
    issues in a project the size of FreeBSD is monitoring changes in
    performance characteristics over time.  Doing this requires several
    things.  Those include a suite of appropriate tests, hardware to run
    the tests on, a database to store results in, and software to
    extract interesting results and display them.  Solving the whole
    problems is probably beyond the scope of one summer's work, but an
    interesting subset should be manageable.   <a
    href="mailto:brooks@FreeBSD.org">&a.brooks;</a> is the coordinator.</li>

</ul>

<a name="p-filesystem"></a>
<h3>Filesystem</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>inode versioning</strong>: Introduce an inode version
    number into UFS, so we can store inodes in different formats. As
    an example of how to use this, introduce a new inode format that
    has a 32 bit link count field.  <a
    href="mailto:dwmalone@freebsd.org">&a.dwmalone;</a> is the
    coordinator.</li>

  <li><strong>Autofs</strong>: Create the autofs filesystem from a
    specification.  Candidates should have some filesystem knowledge
    and network filesystem knowledge.  Most of this work is done,
    however kernel transport and interaction with the "amd"
    automounter needs to be completed. <a
    href="mailto:alfred@FreeBSD.org">&a.alfred;</a> is coordinating.</li>

  <li><strong>Logical Volume Manager</strong></li>

  <li><strong>Magic Symlinks</strong>: Implement magic symlinks.
    Candidates should have some filesystem knowledge. 
    Experimental
    <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/~jwd/magiclinks.tgz">patches</a>    
    exist against 4-STABLE, though the DragonFly implementation using the
    setvar utility should be examined.
    <a href="mailto:jwd@FreeBSD.org">&a.jwd;</a> can coordinate.</li>
  
</ul>

<a name="p-networking"></a>
<h3>Networking</h3>

<ul>

  <li><strong>IPv6 stack vulnerabilities</strong>: Review the last few
    years worth of IP stack vulnerabilities. Check that these have been
    fixed in the IPv6 stack too. Fix ones that haven't been fixed. <a
    href="mailto:dwmalone@freebsd.org">&a.dwmalone;</a> is the
    coordinator.</li>

  <li><strong>IPv6 feature parity</strong>: Review new features that
    have been added to the IP stack (hostcache, TCP MD5 checksums,
    ...). Check if these include IPv6 support.  Implement if it
    hasn't.  <a href="mailto:dwmalone@freebsd.org">&a.dwmalone;</a> is
    the coordinator.</li>

  <li><strong>Network Disk Device</strong>: Add the ability to
    remotely access devices from one system to another.  The goal is
    to allow remote access to resources such as disks, sound devices,
    and other miscellaneous pieces of hardware over the network.
    Prospective candidates should have an understanding or interest in
    remote procedure call systems, networking (TCP/IP), an interest to
    learn how Unix device drivers work as well as process management
    will be required.  This project would be a good resume builder,
    but is not for the faint of heart.  <a
    href="mailto:alfred@FreeBSD.org">&a.alfred;</a> is coordinating.</li>

  <li><strong>NFS Lockd (improve semantics)</strong>: Improve the
    semantics of the NFS lockd in FreeBSD.  Apple has made certain
    enhancements that can be leveraged in our code base.  Implement
    state recovery in the lockd. Candidate would learn how to port
    code from one kernel to another as well as how to maintain state
    on the client side.  This would be a good resume addition. <a
    href="mailto:alfred@FreeBSD.org">&a.alfred;</a> is coordinating.</li>

  <li><strong>NFS Lockd (kernel implementation)</strong>: Improve the
    semantics of the NFS lockd in FreeBSD.  Moving the lockd
    implementation into the kernel provides several key performance
    and semantic improvements.  Candidates should have a good
    understanding of NFS, locking, RPC and kernel networking.  This is
    a great resume addition, providing you want to be saddled with
    "knowing NFS" for the rest of your career, it is not for the faint
    of heart. <a href="mailto:alfred@FreeBSD.org">&a.alfred;</a> is
    coordinating.</li>

</ul>

<a name="p-security"></a>
<h3>Security</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>SecureMines</strong>: Add meta-data to the
    system in order to trap intruders and provide an audit log.  The
    goal of this project is to create several means of marking an
    event as a foreign act (such as opening a trap file) which halts
    the system and provides as much information as possible,
    possibilities include using extended attributes to tag such
    "mines".  Candidates should have an understanding of the Unix
    process model. <a
    href="mailto:alfred@FreeBSD.org">&a.alfred;</a> is coordinating.</li>

  <li><strong>SEBSD</strong>: SEBSD is a port of NSA's SELinux FLASK/TE
    security model to the FreeBSD operating system using the TrustedBSD MAC
    Framework.  Right now the system is highly experimental, and a great
    project would be for one or more students to spend the summer taking it
    from an experimental prototype to something that can be actually used.
    This might include the development of policy, integration of SEBSD into
    the installer components, adaptation of userland components, sample
    deployments, documentation, and so on.  Candidates will want some
    background in access control technology, especially mandatory access
    control; experience with alternative security models would be a plus, as
    would a background in OS development.  However, there's room for a
    range of work here, and all proposals will be considered!  <a
    href="mailto:rwatson@FreeBSD.org">&a.rwatson;</a> is coordinating.</li>
</ul>

<a name="p-kernel"></a>
<h3>Kernel</h3>

<ul>

  <li><strong>Generic Input Device Subsystem</strong>: Some work has
    been done in Perforce that begins to replace the ancient
    psm->moused->syscons codepath into something more pleasant.
    There's still a lot of duplication between psm and moused, however
    and even more work is necessary to get syscons to be happy with
    the new world order.  <a
    href="mailto:philip@FreeBSD.org">&a.philip;</a> is coordinating.</li>

  <li><strong>Update the Linuxulator</strong>: FreeBSD provides Linux
    binary compatibility through a Linux system call table that is
    invoked when Linux ELF binaries are executed.  This implementation
    should be compared with an up-to-date Linux Kernel so that
    important missing syscalls can be added to ensure that all
    mainstream applications continue to work on FreeBSD.  The student
    should be able to read and understand foreign C code, write C
    code, and have a good understanding of how to do a clean room
    implementation of GPLed code (no copy & paste!).</li>

  <li><strong>Implement passive cooling in ACPI thermal</strong>: The
    cpufreq interface should be used to cool the processor, based on
    the various _PSV settings.  Also, we need to implement variable
    polling intervals for thermal zones based on both the passive
    settings and polling explicitly specified in the ASL.  This
    project requires good knowledge of C, an understanding of the
    hardware/software interface, a laptop that works with ACPI, and
    kernel awareness.  <a href="mailto:njl@FreeBSD.org">&a.njl;</a>
    and <a href="mailto:bruno@FreeBSD.og">&a.bruno;</a> are
    coordinating.</li>

  <li><strong>Suspend to disk</strong>: Implement a suspend/resume
    from disk mechanism.  Possibly use the dump functions to dump
    pages to disk, then use ACPI to put the system in S4 or power-off.
    Resume would require changes to the loader to load the memory
    image directly and then begin executing again.  This project
    requires good knowledge of C, an understanding of the
    hardware/software interface, a laptop that works with ACPI, and
    kernel awareness. <a href="mailto:njl@FreeBSD.org">&a.njl;</a>
    and <a href="mailto:bruno@FreeBSD.og">&a.bruno;</a> are
    coordinating.</li>

  <li><strong>Implement and profile various algorithms for
    powerd(8)</strong>: Implement a range of predictive algorithms
    (and perhaps design your own) and profile them for power usage and
    performance loss.  The best algorithm will save the most power
    while losing the least performance.  Requires basic C knowledge,
    laptop supported by cpufreq(4) (suggest newer Pentium-M CPU), and
    some statistics.  <a href="mailto:njl@FreeBSD.org">&a.njl;</a>
    and <a href="mailto:bruno@FreeBSD.og">&a.bruno;</a> are
    coordinating.</li>

  <li><strong>Kernel meta-language</strong>: Develop a dialect of the
    C language that simplifies the task of writing kernel code.
    It should include language extensions that make it
    possible to write kernel code more cleanly and with less bugs. An
    example of this would have language support for linked lists,
    to obviate the need for messy MACROs.  <a 
    href="mailto:gnn@FreeBSD.org">&a.gnn;</a> and <a 
    href="mailto:phk@FreeBSD.org">&a.phk;</a> are coordinating.  A Wiki
    with more information is available <a 
    href="http://wikitest.freebsd.org/moin.cgi/K">here</a>.</li>
