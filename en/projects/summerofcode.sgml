<h2>Example Proposal Ideas</h2>

<a name="p-userland"></a>
<h3>Userland / Installation Tools</h3>

<ul>
<!--  <li><strong>FreeBSD website redesign</strong></li> -->
  <li><strong>Integrate BSD Installer</strong>: Prepare a prototype
    merge of the <a href="http://www.bsdinstaller.org/">BSD
    Installer</a> as a complete replacement for the venerable FreeBSD
    sysinstall program.  Enough of the groundwork has been laid out now
    that someone with a few months and some background could do a lot
    of good work here, especially with adequate mentoring by more
    senior FreeBSD developers.</li>

  <li><strong>Bundled PXE Installer</strong>: It would be great to
    have a bundled PXE installer.  This would allow one to boot an
    install server from a FreeSBIE live CDROM on one box, set the BIOS
    on subsequent boxes to PXE boot, and then have the rest happen by
    magic.  This would be very helpful for installing cluster nodes,
    etc.</li>

  <li><strong>Fully Integrated SNMP monitoring</strong>: Plugins for
    our BSNMP pieces to monitor elements of system state such as load,
    disk space, VM statistics, entropy, firewall rules and states,
    sendmail queues and accepts/rejects, and the like.  An SNMP client
    that could pull and centralize the data gathering, render it,
    etc.  <a href="mailto:philip@FreeBSD.org">&a.philip;</a>, <a
    href="mailto:glebius@FreeBSD.org">&a.glebius;</a>, and <a
    href="mailto:rwatson@FreeBSD.org">&a.rwatson;</a> are
    coordinating.</li>

  <li><strong>Integrate Xen Support</strong>: Support for the <a
    href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/SRG/netos/xen/">Xen virtual
    machine monitor</a> is coming into FreeBSD -CURRENT, so the
    installer could be updated to make it possible to setup a Xen
    system with several FreeBSD nodes, etc.</li>

  <li><strong>Rewrite CVSup in C</strong>: <a
    href="http://www.cvsup.org">CVSup</a> is the CVS-Optimized
    General-Purpose Network File Distribution System.  It has been
    used heavily for nearly 10 years to distribute the FreeBSD CVS
    tree to mirrors around the world.  CVSup was written in Modula-3
    and a rewrite in C would encourage more users to improve it.
    CVSup is a multi-threaded application by design so the applicant
    should have at least some experience with pthreads.
    Additional requested features include understanding of Subversion
    fsfs repositories and Perforce depots.  Currently part of the work
    and research has already been completed. <a
    href="mailto:mux@FreeBSD.org">&a.mux;</a> is the coordinator.</li>

  <li><strong>Improve our regression testing system</strong>: Nik
    Clayton has written a regression test infrastructure using Perl.
    More of the regression tests should be made to work with libtap.
    There are two main parts to it.  First, many of the existing tests
    should be moved from using assert() to using ok() and friends from
    libtap.  Second, more regression tests should be written.
    Students familiar with scripting languages and software testing
    are encouraged to work on this.  <a
    href="mailto:nik@FreeBSD.org">&a.nik;</a> is the coordinator.
</li>

  <li><strong>Tracking performance over time</strong>: One of the major
    issues in a project the size of FreeBSD is monitoring changes in
    performance characteristics over time.  Doing this requires several
    things.  Those include a suite of appropriate tests, hardware to run
    the tests on, a database to store results in, and software to
    extract intresting results and display them.  Solving the whole
    problems is probably beyond the scope of one summer's work, but an
    intresting subset should be managable.   <a
    href="mailto:brooks@FreeBSD.org">&a.brooks;</a> is the coordinator.</li>

</ul>

<a name="p-filesystem"></a>
<h3>Filesystem</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>UFS Journalling</strong>: Add transaction journalling and
    playback to the UFS filesystem.  The goal is to increase the reliability
    of the filesystem and greatly reduce the need for a full 'fsck' after
    a crash or power loss.  This is a project that deals with not only
    the filesystem internals, but also the VM and buffer/cache systems,
    so it is an excellent opportunity to learn about many fundamental
    aspects of an operating system.<br>

    Work is already in progress on this task, but more help is always
    needed and welcome.  Candidates should have at least a cursory
    understanding of filesystem data structures (inodes, free lists,
    directories) and a strong desire to learn more about such systems.
    This project would be a major contribution to anyone's resume, but it
    is not for the faint of heart.  <a
    href="mailto:scottl@FreeBSD.org">&a.scottl;</a> is the coordinator.

  <li><strong>Autofs</strong>: Create the autofs filesystem from a
    specification.  Candidates should have some filesystem knowledge
    and network filesystem knowledge.  Most of this work is done,
    however kernel transport and interaction with the "amd"
    automounter needs to be completed. <a
    href="mailto:alfred@FreeBSD.org">&a.alfred;</a> is coordinating.</li>

  <li><strong>Logical Volume Manager</strong></li>
  
</ul>

<a name="p-networking"></a>
<h3>Networking</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Network Disk Device</strong>: Add the ability to
    remotely access devices from one system to another.  The goal is
    to allow remote access to resources such as disks, sound devices,
    and other miscellaneous pieces of hardware over the network.
    Prospective candidates should have an understanding or interest in
    remote procedure call systems, networking (TCP/IP), an interest to
    learn how Unix device drivers work as well as process management
    will be required.  This project would be a good resume builder,
    but is not for the faint of heart.  <a
    href="mailto:alfred@FreeBSD.org">&a.alfred;</a> is coordinating.</li>

  <li><strong>NFS Lockd (improve semantics)</strong>: Improve the
    semantics of the NFS lockd in FreeBSD.  Apple has made certain
    enhancements that can be leveraged in our code base.  Implement
    state recovery in the lockd. Candidate would learn how to port
    code from one kernel to another as well as how to maintain state
    on the client side.  This would be a good resume addition. <a
    href="mailto:alfred@FreeBSD.org">&a.alfred;</a> is coordinating.</li>

  <li><strong>NFS Lockd (kernel implementation)</strong>: Improve the
    semantics of the NFS lockd in FreeBSD.  Moving the lockd
    implementation into the kernel provides several key performance
    and semantic improvements.  Candidates should have a good
    understanding of NFS, locking, RPC and kernel networking.  This is
    a great resume addition, providing you want to be saddled with
    "knowing NFS" for the rest of your career, it is not for the faint
    of heart. <a href="mailto:alfred@FreeBSD.org">&a.alfred;</a> is
    coordinating.</li>

  <li><strong>Userland/kernel interface cleanups (net/if_var.h)</strong>:
    Over <em>eight</em> years ago, the network interface headers
    were split into net/if.h and net/if_var.h.  The intent was for
    net/if_var.h to be kernel only and net/if.h to contain public
    interfaces.  Today, the internal header, net/if_var.h is still
    included in many userland applications.  In some cases, this is
    due to interfaces that are not in fact kernel internal.  In other
    cases, these structures are being used in conjunction with libkvm to
    access kernel information directly.  This project would correct both
    classes of problems, primarily rewriting the netstat(1) command and
    any other network related libkvm consumers to user alternate
    interfaces, creating those interfaces if needed.  Netstat's
    coredump analysis features would likely be split into a separate
    program.  <a href="mailto:brooks@FreeBSD.org">&a.brooks;</a> is
    coordinating.</li>

  <li><strong>Web100 port to FreeBSD</strong>: The <a
    href="http://www.web100.org/">Web100</a> project was created to
    address the problems of TCP performance over long-fat network
    pipes.  They created an intresting set of tuning and monitoring
    patches for Linux which enable signifcantly better performance
    in this area.  Integrating this work into FreeBSD could provide
    significant benefits in terms of TCP performance in certain
    environments.  The features of Web100 need to be mapped into
    appropriate FreeBSD abstractions and integrated in to the
    system.  The performance impact of these changes would have
    to be quantified before the changes could be introduced.  An
    ideal canidate for this task would have some knowledge of the
    operation of the TCP protocol and familiarity with kernel
    interfaces. <a href="mailto:brooks@FreeBSD.org">&a.brooks;</a> is
    coordinating.</li>

</ul>

<a name="p-security"></a>
<h3>Security</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>SecureMines</strong>: Add meta-data to the
    system in order to trap intruders and provide an audit log.  The
    goal of this project is to create several means of marking an
    event as a foreign act (such as opening a trap file) which halts
    the system and provides as much information as possible,
    possibilities include using extended attributes to tag such
    "mines".  Candidates should have an understanding of the Unix
    process model. <a
    href="mailto:alfred@FreeBSD.org">&a.alfred;</a> is coordinating.</li>
      
</ul>

<a name="p-kernel"></a>
<h3>Kernel</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Update the Linuxulator</strong>: FreeBSD provides Linux
    binary compatibility through a Linux system call table that is
    invoked when Linux ELF binaries are executed.  This implementation
    should be compared with an up-to-date Linux Kernel so that
    important missing syscalls can be added to ensure that all
    mainstream applications continue to work on FreeBSD.  The student
    should be able to read and understand foreign C code, write C
    code, and have a good understanding of how to do a clean room
    implementation of GPLed code (no copy & paste!).</li>
