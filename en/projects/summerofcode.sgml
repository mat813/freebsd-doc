<p>The FreeBSD Project is excited to take part in the Google <a
  href="http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html">Summer of Code
  2005</a>.  This project endeavors to fund students to contribute to
  an open source project over the summer break.</p>

<a name="ideas"></a>
<h3 class="red">Example Proposal Ideas</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Integrate BSD Installer</strong> : Prepare a prototype
    merge of the <a href="http://www.bsdinstaller.org/">BSD
    Installer</a> as a complete replacement for the venerable FreeBSD
    sysinstall program.  Enough of the groundwork has been laid out now
    that someone with a few months and some background could do a lot
    of good work here, especially with adequate mentoring by more
    senior FreeBSD developers.</li>

  <li><strong>Bundled PXE Installer</strong> : It would be great to
    have a bundled PXE installer.  This would allow one to boot an
    install server from a FreeSBIE live CDROM on one box, set the BIOS
    on subsequent boxes to PXE boot, and then have the rest happen by
    magic.  This would be very helpful for installing cluster nodes,
    etc.</li>

  <li><strong>Fully Integrated SNMP monitoring</strong> : Plugins for
    our BSNMP pieces to monitor useful system state, an SNMP client
    that could pull and centralize the data gathering, render it,
    etc.</li>

  <li><strong>Integrate Xen Support</strong> : Support for the <a
    href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/SRG/netos/xen/">Xen virtual
    machine monitor</a> is coming into FreeBSD -CURRENT, so the
    installer could be updated to make it possible to setup a Xen
    system with several FreeBSD nodes, etc.</li>

  <li><strong>Rewrite CVSup in C</strong> : <a
    href="http://www.cvsup.org">CVSup</a> is the CVS-Optimized
    General-Purpose Network File Distribution System.  It has been
    used heavily for nearly 10 years to distribute the FreeBSD CVS
    tree to mirrors around the world.  CVSup was written in Modula-3
    and a rewrite in C would encourage more users to improve it.
    Additional requested features include understanding of Subversion
    fsfs repositories and Perforce depots.  <a
    href="mailto:mux@FreeBSD.org">&a.mux;</a></li>

  <li><strong>UFS Journalling</strong> : Add meta-data journalling to
    the UFS filesystem.  The goal is to increase the reliability and
    speed of meta-data operations under the UFS filesystem.
    Candidates should have at least a cursory understanding of
    filesystem data structures (inodes, free lists, directories) and a
    strong desire to learn more about such systems.  This project will
    be a major contributions to anyone's resume, but it is not for the
    faint of heart.  <a
    href="mailto:alfred@FreeBSD.org">&a.alfred;</a>, <a
    href="mailto:scottl@FreeBSD.org">&a.scottl;</a>, <a
    href="mailto:hmp@FreeBSD.org">&a.hmp;</a></li>


  <li><strong>Network Disk Device</strong> : Add the ability to
    remotely access devices from one system to another.  The goal is
    to allow remote access to resources such as disks, sound devices,
    and other miscellaneous pieces of hardware over the network.
    Prospective candidates should have an understanding or interest in
    remote procedure call systems, networking (TCP/IP), an interest to
    learn how Unix device drivers work as well as process management
    will be required.  This project would be a good resume builder,
    but is not for the faint of heart.  <a
    href="mailto:alfred@FreeBSD.org">&a.alfred;</a>.</li>

<!--  <li><strong>FreeBSD website redesign</strong></li> -->

  <li><strong>Logical Volume Manager</strong></li>
