<br>
<p>This was posted to announce@freebsd.org:<p>
The FreeBSD Foundation has secured a license from Sun Microsystems to
distribute a native FreeBSD version of both the Java Development Kit (JDK)
and the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). Thanks to the great efforts of
the FreeBSD Java team, these should be available for inclusion with the
upcoming release of FreeBSD 4.5 in January, 2002.
<p>
The general availability of a distributable version of Java will
benefit end users, commercial users, and developers who use FreeBSD.
Java continues to grow in popularity and has become heavily used in
server side web applications, one of FreeBSD's core areas of strength.
With an officially licensed binary Java distribution, FreeBSD becomes
an ideal platform for execution, development, and deployment of Java
based solutions.
<p>
This agreement would not have been possible without the efforts of
<a href="mailto:nate@FreeBSD.org">Nate Williams</a>. Nate not only
started the FreeBSD Java porting effort, but also brought Sun Microsystems
and the Foundation together to negotiate a license.

<li><b>August 10, 2000:</b> On August 7th, 2000, the FreeBSD JDK team 
was given access to Sun's JCK (Java Compatibility Kit), 
which will allow us to test and (hopefully!)
release a binary version using the current set of patches.
Unfortunately, we are unable (for legal reasons) to distribute a JDK
that hasn't been run against the JCK like we were able to with the
JDK1.1.* releases.

<P>Unfortunately, as told by Sun (we have no experience *yet*), running the
JCK against the port is a difficult and time-consuming process.
Hopefully it won't take us the 3 months that Sun expects it to take. :(

<P>Finally, there are still some issues regarding Motif that need to be
resolved before a full public release can be made.  Sun is working on
that front, and we need to try contacting the OpenGroup to see if we can
get a special exception for Motif binary distributions to use in the JDK
release.

<li><b>May 3, 2000:</b> Native JDK 1.2.2 port enters alpha test phase
<br>Greg Lewis has just announced that the native FreeBSD JDK 1.2.2 port
has entered alpha test stage.
<br>In its current form, the port will build and run on most FreeBSD releases
(3.4, 4.0 and 5.0 on x86) and work is being done on the others (2.2.8 on x86
and 4.0 alpha).  Most demo applets and applications run.
<br>Currently we are looking for enthusiasts who are willing to spend a
little time testing the new port.  While this is not a trivial task, there are
 clear step-by-step instructions on how to build and use the port.
<br>The patches may be found, as usual on:

small patchset was re-rolled for those folks who are experiencing this
problem.  If you experience this problem, feel free to download the
gzipped tarfile and untar it wherever you installed the jdk.  It will
install itself over top of the old version.  If you aren't experiencing

JDK2 (aka JDK1.2): Several individuals are working on porting JDK2 to
