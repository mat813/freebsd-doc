<P>Installing FreeBSD's &jdk; is typically straightforward:</P>
<P><CODE>cd /usr/ports/java/jdk
<BR>make
<BR>make install
<BR>make clean
</CODE></P>

<P>The JDK does not require any dependencies to install.  However, if you wish to run any graphics, you will need to have X installed and running.

<P>Many applications in Java need Java Foundation Classes (Swing) to run. JFC can be installed in: <CODE>/usr/ports/java/jfc</CODE> 

<P>If you should have trouble, you can see the <A HREF="../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/ports.html">FreeBSD Handbook section on &quot;installing applications&quot;</A> for help.
