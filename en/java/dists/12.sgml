<b>March 22, 2000:</b>: Greg Lewis releases the pre-alpha patches for enterprising
Java users to build their own native FreeBSD JDK&nbsp;1.2.2 from. This
process is not for the faint of heart, and the resulting JDK is not for
production systems. Having said that, most AWT and Swing demo's have been
found to run. There is plenty of work to do, and we need all the testers we
can find. Patches and build instructions may be downloaded from
<A HREF="http://www.eyesbeyond.com/freebsd-jdk122-patches-4.tar.gz">http://www.eyesbeyond.com/freebsd-jdk122-patches-4.tar.gz</A>. Currently open
issues and test results may be found at

<b>January 30, 2000:</b> The Linux Blackdown Port Team has released RC4 of JDK 1.2
.  It has been tested on FreeBSD 3.4-STABLE and later and runs all demo applets
and jfc demos.  Several people have mentioned some problems running it with
Apache JServ.  Until it can be added to the FreeBSD port tree, it can be found
at <a href="http://www.jmcm.org/tech/ports/linux_jdk.html">
http://www.jmcm.org/tech/ports/linux_jdk.html</a>.  (Reported by Jose Marques)

<P>
<B>October 11, 1999:</B> Work has re-started on the Java2/JDK1.2 port. 
Expect an early 'alpha' release in the coming weeks for FreeBSD
3.3-stable/ELF boxes.

<P>For most JDK2 development issues, you can use the JDK1 release and the 
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/index.html#download-swing">Swing</A>
releases provided by Sun for JDK1, which works very well under FreeBSD.
