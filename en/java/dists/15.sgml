<b>January 19, 2005:</b> <a href="mailto:glewis@FreeBSD.org">Greg
Lewis</a> has released the first patchset (patchlevel 1, "Sabretooth")
for the &jdk;&nbsp;1.5.0 software.  This initial patchset is only suitable
for early testers and developers.  Support for the following
versions of FreeBSD is included -- <b>i386/5.3</b> and <b>amd64/5.3</b>.
Information on downloading the patchset can be found at
<a href="http://www.eyesbeyond.com/freebsddom/java/jdk15.html">http://www.eyesbeyond.com/freebsddom/java/jdk15.html</a>.

<p>
<b>April 7, 2005:</b> The java/jdk15 port has been updated so that it
builds on FreeBSD 4.11/i386.  Unfortunately there are still serious
run time issues on this platform.
