new network-based messaging language that increases productivity, 
cuts application size, and reduces application time-to-market. The 
language is human-centric, instead of computer-centric, and offers a 
new alternative to anachronistic programming languages like Java and 
C++ and scripting languages like PERL and Tcl.  REBOL is compact, 
platform independent, and functions over a network or on a single 
system.  It is ideally suited for webmasters, technicians, hobbyists, 
educators, experimenters, and any one who requires a simple, customizable,
robust, easy-to-understand language. Download <EM>The Language of the
