  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>This web page is designed to assist both new and experienced
    users in the area of FreeBSD security.  FreeBSD takes security
    very seriously and is constantly working on making the OS as
    secure as possible.</p>

  <p>Here you will find additional information, or links to
    information, on how to protect your system against various types
    of attack, on whom to contact if you find a security-related bug,
    and so on.  There is also a section on the various ways that the
    systems programmer can become more security conscious so that he
    is less likely to introduce vulnerabilities.</p>

  <a name="how"></a>
  <p>All FreeBSD Security issues should be reported directly to the <a
    href="mailto:security@FreeBSD.org">Security Officer Team</a>
    personally or otherwise to the <a
    href="mailto:security-officer@FreeBSD.org"> Security Officer</a>.
    All reports should at least contain:<br><br> A description of the
    vulnerability;<br> What versions of FreeBSD seem to be affected if
    possible;<br> Any plausible workaround;<br> And example code if
    possible.<br></p>

  <p>After this information has been reported the Security Officer or
    a Security Team delegate will get back with you.</p>

  <a name=sec></a>
  <h2>The FreeBSD Security Officer and the Security Officer Team</h2>

  <p>To better coordinate information exchange with others in the
    security community, FreeBSD has a focal point for security-related
    communications: the FreeBSD Security Officer.</p>

  <p>If you need to contact the FreeBSD Project about a possible
    security issue, you should therefore <a
      href="mailto:security-officer@FreeBSD.org">send mail to the
    Security Officer</a> with a description of what you have found and
    the type of vulnerability it represents.</p>

  <p>In order that the FreeBSD Project may respond to vulnerability
    reports in a timely manner, there are four members of the Security
    Officer mail alias: the Security Officer, Security Officer
    Emeritus, Deputy Security Officer, and one Core Team member.
    Therefore, messages sent to the <a
    href="mailto:security-officer@FreeBSD.org">&lt;security-officer@FreeBSD.org&gt;</a>
    mail alias are currently delivered to:</p>

  <table>
    <tr valign="top">
      <td>&a.cperciva; <a
        href="mailto:cperciva@FreeBSD.org">&lt;cperciva@FreeBSD.org&gt;</a></td>
      <td>Security Officer</td>
    </tr>
    <tr valign="top">
      <td>&a.nectar; <a
        href="mailto:nectar@FreeBSD.org">&lt;nectar@FreeBSD.org&gt;</a></td>
      <td>Security Officer Emeritus</td>
    </tr>
    <tr valign="top">
      <td>&a.simon; <a
        href="mailto:simon@FreeBSD.org">&lt;simon@FreeBSD.org&gt;</a></td>
      <td>Deputy Security Officer</td>
    </tr>
    <tr valign="top">
      <td>&a.rwatson; <a
        href="mailto:rwatson@FreeBSD.org">&lt;rwatson@FreeBSD.org&gt;</a></td>
      <td>FreeBSD Core Team liaison, Release Engineering liaison,<br>
          TrustedBSD Project liaison, system security architecture expert</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>The Security Officer is supported by the <a
      href="mailto:security@FreeBSD.org">FreeBSD Security Team
    &lt;security@FreeBSD.org&gt;</a>, a small group of committers
    vetted by the Security Officer.</p>

  <p>Please use the <a
    href="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/public_key.asc">Security
    Officer PGP key</a> to encrypt your messages to the Security
    Officer when appropriate.</p>

  <a name="pol"></a>
  <h2>Information handling policies</h2>

  <p>As a general policy, the FreeBSD Security Officer favors full
    disclosure of vulnerability information after a reasonable delay
    to permit safe analysis and correction of a vulnerability, as well
    as appropriate testing of the correction, and appropriate
    coordination with other affected parties.</p>

  <p>The Security Officer <em>will</em> notify one or more of the <a
      href="mailto:admins@FreeBSD.org">FreeBSD Cluster Admins</a> of
    vulnerabilities that put the FreeBSD Project's resources under
    immediate danger.</p>

  <p>The Security Officer may bring additional FreeBSD developers or
    outside developers into discussion of a submitted security
    vulnerability if their expertise is required to fully understand
    or correct the problem.  Appropriate discretion will be exercised
    to minimize unnecessary distribution of information about the
    submitted vulnerability, and any experts brought in will act in
    accordance of Security Officer policies.  In the past, experts
    have been brought in based on extensive experience with highly
    complex components of the operating system, including FFS, the VM
    system, and the network stack.</p>

  <p>If a FreeBSD release process is underway, the FreeBSD Release
    Engineer may also be notified that a vulnerability exists, and its
    severity, so that informed decisions may be made regarding the
    release cycle and any serious security bugs present in software
    associated with an up-coming release.  If requested, the Security
    Officer will not share information regarding the nature of the
    vulnerability with the Release Engineer, limiting information flow
    to existence and severity.</p>

  <p>The FreeBSD Security Officer has close working relationships with
    a number of other organizations, including third-party vendors
    that share code with FreeBSD (the OpenBSD, NetBSD and DragonFlyBSD
    projects, Apple, and other vendors deriving software from FreeBSD,
    as well as the Linux vendor security list), as well as
    organizations that track vulnerabilities and security incidents,
    such as CERT.  Frequently vulnerabilities may extend beyond the
    scope of the FreeBSD implementation, and (perhaps less frequently)
    may have broad implications for the global networking community.
    Under such circumstances, the Security Officer may wish to
    disclose vulnerability information to these other organizations:
    if you do not wish the Security Officer to do this, please
    indicate so explicitly in any submissions.</p>

  <p>Submitters should be careful to explicitly document any special
    information handling requirements.</p>

  <p>If the submitter of a vulnerability is interested in a
    coordinated disclosure process with the submitter and/or other
    vendors, this should be indicated explicitly in any submissions.
    In the absence of explicit requests, the FreeBSD Security Officer
    will select a disclosure schedule that reflects both a desire for
    timely disclosure and appropriate testing of any solutions.
    Submitters should be aware that if the vulnerability is being
    actively discussed in public forums (such as bugtraq), and
    actively exploited, the Security Officer may choose not to follow
    a proposed disclosure timeline in order to provide maximum
    protection for the user community.</p>

  <p>Submissions may be protected using PGP.  If desired, responses
    will also be protected using PGP.</p>

  <h2>FreeBSD Security Advisories</h2>

  <p>The FreeBSD Security Officer provides security advisories for
    several branches of FreeBSD development.  These are the
    <em>-STABLE Branches</em> and the <em>Security Branches</em>.
    (Advisories are not issued for the <em>-CURRENT Branch</em>.)</p>

  <ul>

    <li><p>There is usually only a single -STABLE branch, although
      during the transition from one major development line to another
      (such as from FreeBSD 4.x to 5.x), there is a time span in which
      there are two -STABLE branches.  The -STABLE branch tags have
      names like <tt>RELENG_4</tt>.  The corresponding builds have
      names like <tt>FreeBSD 4.10-STABLE</tt>.</p></li>

    <li><p>Each FreeBSD Release has an associated Security Branch.
      The Security Branch tags have names like <tt>RELENG_4_10</tt>.
      The corresponding builds have names like <tt>FreeBSD
      4.10-RELEASE-p5</tt>.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Issues affecting the FreeBSD Ports Collection are covered in <a
      href="http://vuxml.FreeBSD.org/">the FreeBSD VuXML
      document</a>.</p>

  <p>Each branch is supported by the Security Officer for a limited
    time only, and is designated as one of `<em>Early adopter</em>',
    `<em>Normal</em>', or `<em>Extended</em>'.  The designation is
    used as a guideline for determining the lifetime of the branch as
    follows.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Early adopter</dt>
    <dd>Releases which are published from the -CURRENT branch will be
      supported by the Security Officer for a minimum of 6 months after
      the release.</dd>
    <dt>Normal</dt>
    <dd>Releases which are published from the -STABLE branch will be
      supported by the Security Officer for a minimum of 12 months after the
      release.</dd>
    <dt>Extended</dt>
    <dd>Selected releases will be supported by the Security Officer for a
      minimum of 24 months after the release.</dd>
  </dl>

  <a name="supported-branches"></a>

  <p>The current designation and estimated lifetimes of the currently
    supported branches are given below.  The <em>Estimated EoL
    (end-of-life)</em> column gives the earliest date on which that
    branch is likely to be dropped.  Please note that these dates may
    be extended into the future, but only extenuating circumstances
    would lead to a branch's support being dropped earlier than the
    date listed.</p>

      list of supported branches.

  <p>Older releases are not maintained and users are strongly
    encouraged to upgrade to one of the supported releases mentioned
    above.</p>

  <p>Some statistics about advisories released during 2002:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>44 advisories of varying severity were issued for the base
      system.</li>
    <li>12 advisories described vulnerabilities found only in FreeBSD.
      The remaining 32 were problems shared with at least one other OS
      (often due to shared code).</li>

    <li>6 security notices were issued, covering a total of 95 issues
      in optional third party applications included in the Ports
      Collection.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Advisories are sent to the following FreeBSD mailing lists:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>FreeBSD-security-notifications@FreeBSD.org</li>
    <li>FreeBSD-security@FreeBSD.org</li>
    <li>FreeBSD-announce@FreeBSD.org</li>
