    <p>These bylaws were approved by a vote of active committers on
      August 28, 2000.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Active committers have made a commit to the tree in the last 12
	months.</li>

      <li>Core consists of 9 elected active committers.</li>

      <li>Core elections are held every 2 years, first time September 2000.</li>

      <li>Core members and committers may be ejected by a 2/3 vote of core.</li>

      <li>If the size of core falls below 7, an early election is held.</li>

      <li>A petition of 1/3 of active committers can trigger an early
	election.</li>

      <li>All elections will be run as follows:

	<ul>
	  <li>Core appoints and announces someone to run the election.</li>

	  <li>1 week to tally active committers wishing to run for core.</li>

	  <li>4 weeks for the actual vote</li>

	  <li>1 week to tally and post the results.</li>

	  <li>Each active committer may vote once in support of up to nine
	    nominees.</li>

	  <li>New core team becomes effective 1 week after the results are
	    posted.</li>

	  <li>Voting ties decided by unambiguously elected new core
	    members.</li>
	</ul>
      </li>

	<li>These rules can be changed by a 2/3 majority of committers if at
	least 50% of active committers cast their vote.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The last core election was held in September of 2000.  The next core
      election will be held in September of 2002.</p>
