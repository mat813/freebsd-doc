    <p>Portmgr's charter, as approved by core and published in
       November 2001.</p>

    <p>The portmgr team may approve new ports committers by decision-making
       processes it deems appropriate.  All committer approvals must be sent
       to admins@, and CC'd to core; they must be PGP-signed.  The portmgr
       team manages the ports portion of the FreeBSD repository.  The
       membership of the portmgr team is the current alias on
       freefall.freebsd.org.</p>

    <p>This charter is valid until such time as it is modified or revoked by
       the Core Team; any changes to this charter must be approved by the Core
       Team.</p>
