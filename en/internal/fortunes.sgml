  <h2>Policy</h2>

  <p>Before committing to the fortune file, please remember the
    classic Usenet "rule":</p>

  <p>"Be conservative in what you expect others to accept and liberal
    in what you are prepared to accept."</p>

  <p>If an entry offends more than a couple of FreeBSD committers and
    does not contain any objective poignant historical reference, the
    entry should be in the offensive file.</p>

  <p>Examples of offensive entries:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Those that belittle groups on the basis of their gender,
      nationality, religion, or lifestyle.</li>
    <li>Profanity, "adult" content.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Examples of entries that should not usually be declared
  'offensive':</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Hitler quotes.</li>
    <li>Jokes about emacs/vi or your favorite technology, as long as
      they stay in good fun and don't cross the line of a being a
      vicious personal attack on the designer.</li>
  </ul>

  <p> If you add new material to the fortunes collection, please be
    extra-diligent about unforeseen objections, and give plenty of
    time for it to settle before MFCing.</p>

  <p>Additional examples will be added to the offensive and
    unoffensive lists above, as guidelines, whenever core@ is required
    to settle a dispute on this issue.</p>
