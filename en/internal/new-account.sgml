  <h2>Proposing a new committer</h2>

  <p>If you want to propose a new committer, you should send the following
    information to the appropriate entity:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Information on what established (FreeBSD) track record the
      nominee has.  This is <em>not</em> optional; it has become
      standard practice over the last couple of years.</li>
    <li>Who has volunteered to become the mentor for the new
      committer.</li>
    <li>The email address of the nominee (remarkably often this
      is omitted).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Responsible party for this procedure is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>src --&gt; core@</li>
    <li>doc --&gt; doceng@</li>
    <li>ports --&gt; portmgr@</li>
  </ul>

  <p> You will get ACK after the message is seen, and core@ and doceng@
    will give you a response in &lt;= 7 days.  For them, timeout is set
    at 7 days. Timeout for portmgr@ is set at 14 days.
    If voting finishes earlier then the nominator/nominee are informed
    earlier.</p>

  <h2>Authorizing A New Account</h2>

  <p>Someone from the list below sends a PGP-signed email to
    admins@FreeBSD.org, the person assigned as the mentor to the new
    committer, and copied to core@FreeBSD.org confirming the approval of
    the new account.  This email should include a link to this document
    so the mentor/mentee know what is expected of them.</p>

  <p>New account approvals are only valid from these PGP entities:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><p>core-secretary</p></li>
    <li><p>portmgr</p></li>
    <li><p>doceng</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p><i>NOTE:  New account requests from anyone other than these
    entities or requests signed with PGP keys other than from these
    entities will not be acted upon.  No exceptions.</i></p>

  <h2>Information Needed From The Mentor</h2>

  <p>The person assigned as the new committers' mentor needs to collect
    and send the following information to admins@FreeBSD.org:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><p><tt>master.passwd</tt> line containing preferred username,
      shell, and GECOS info (no password is needed)</p></li>
    <li><p>ssh V2 public key (<strong>version 2 ONLY</strong>)</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>The mentor is responsible for obtaining this information from the
    new committer in a secure fashion, and providing it to admins@ in
    a secure fashion.  PGP-signed email, with the mentor's public key
    already committed to the Handbook, is the preferred method for the
    mentor to send the information to admins@.  If this is impossible
    for some reason an acceptable substitute is for the mentor to place
    the account information in their home directory on freefall and then
    tell admins@ where to find it.  We need to be sure the account
    information really is coming from the Mentor and unsigned email is
    not sufficient for this these days.  Since admins@ has no way to
    verify anything from the new Committer this information needs to
    be sent to admins@ by the Mentor, not the new Committer.</p>

  <h2>admins@FreeBSD.org Creates New Account</h2>

  <p>admins@FreeBSD.org creates the new account with the above
    information on the FreeBSD.org cluster and notifies the mentor and
    the new committer.</p>

  <h2>Mentor Activates New Committer's Commit Bit</h2>

  <p>After the new committer confirms that their account works, the mentor
    activates the new committer's commit bit and guides them through the
    rest of the initial process.</p>

  <h2>End Of Mentorship</h2>
   
  <p>There is no pre-set duration for a mentorship.  Once the mentor feels
    the mentee is ready to 'fly solo' the mentor notifies the developer 
    community via a forced commit to <tt>access</tt> with an appropriate 
    commit message.</p>
