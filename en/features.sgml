    <h1>FreeBSD offers many advanced features.</h1>
    
    <blockquote>
      <p>No matter what the application, you want your system's resources
	performing at their full potential.  FreeBSD's advanced features
	enable you to do just that.</p>

	4.4BSD.</font></font>

    <blockquote>
      <p>FreeBSD's distinguished roots derive from the latest <b>BSD</b>
	software releases from the Computer Systems Research Group at the
	University of California, Berkeley.  The book <i>The Design and
	  Implementation of 4.4BSD Operating System</i>, written by the 4.4BSD
	system architects, thus describes much of FreeBSD's core functionality
	in detail.</p>

      <p>Drawing on the skills and experience of a diverse and world-wide
	group of volunteer developers, the FreeBSD Project has worked to
	extend the feature set of the 4.4BSD operating system in many ways,
	striving constantly to make each new release of the OS more stable,
	faster and containing new functionality driven by user requests.</p>

	greater compatibility with other operating systems and less system
	administration.</font></font>

    <blockquote>
      <p>FreeBSD's developers attacked some of the more difficult problems in
	operating systems design to give you these advanced features:</p>
      
      <ul>
	<li><b>A merged virtual memory and filesystem buffer cache</b>
	  continuously tunes the amount of memory used for programs and the
	  disk cache.  As a result, programs receive both excellent memory
	    management and high performance disk access, and the system
	    administrator is freed from the task of tuning cache sizes.</li>
	
	<li><b>Compatibility modules</b> enable programs for other operating
	  systems to run on FreeBSD, including programs for Linux, SCO UNIX,
	  and System V Release 4.</li>
	  
	<li><b>Soft Updates</b> allows improved filesystem
	  performance without sacrificing safety and reliability.
	  It analyzes meta-data filesystem operations to avoid having
	  to perform all of those operations synchronously.
	  Instead, it maintains internal state about pending meta-data
	  operations and uses this information to cache meta-data,
	  rewrite meta-data operations to combine subsequent
	  operations on the same files, and reorder meta-data
	  operations so that they may be processed more efficiently.</li>

	<li><b>Support for IPsec and IPv6</b> allows improved security in
	  networks, and support for the next-generation Internet Protocol,
	  IPv6.  The FreeBSD IPSEC implementation includes support for a
	  broad range of accelerated crypto hardware.</li>

	<li><b>Multi-threaded SMP architecture</b> capable of executing the
	  kernel in parallel on multiple processors, and with <b>kernel
	  preemption</b>, allowing high priority kernel tasks to preempt
	  other kernel activity, reducing latency.  This includes a
	  <b>multi-threaded network stack</b> and a <b>multi-threaded
	  virtual memory subsystem</b>.</li>

	<li><b>M:N threading application threading</b> permitting threads to
	  execute on multiple CPUs in a scaleable manner, mapping many user
	  threads onto a small number of <b>Kernel Schedulable Entities</b>.
	  By adopting the <b>Scheduler Activation</b> model, the threading
	  model can be adapted to the specific requirements of a broad range
	  of applications.</li>

	<li><b>File system snapshots</b>, permitting administrators to take
	  atomic file system snapshots for backup purposes using the free
	  space in the file system, as well as facilitating <b>background
	  fsck</b>, which allows the system to reach multiuser mode without
	  waiting on file system cleanup operations following power outages.
	  </li>

	<li><b>Netgraph pluggable network stack</b> allows developers to
	  dynamically and easily extend the network stack through clean
	  layered network abstractions.  Netgraph nodes can implement a broad
	  range of new network services, including encapsulation, tunneling,
	  encryption, and performance adaptation.</li>

	<li><b>TrustedBSD MAC Framework extensible kernel security</b>,
	  which allows developers to customize the operating system security
	  model for specific environments, from creating hardening policies
	  to deploying mandatory labeled confidentiality of integrity
	  policies.</li>

	<li><b>GEOM pluggable storage layer</b>, which permits new storage
	  services to be quickly developed and cleanly integrated into the
	  FreeBSD storage subsystem.  GEOM provides a consistent and
	  coherrent model for discovering and layering storage services,
	  making it possible to layer services such as RAID and volume
	  management easily.</li>

	<li><b>Kernel Queues</b> allow programs to respond more efficiently
	  to a variety of asynchronous events including file and socket IO,
	  improving application and system performance.</li>

	<li><b>Accept Filters</b> allow connection-intensive applications,
	  such as web servers, to cleanly push part of their functionality into
	  the operating system kernel, improving performance.</li>
      </ul>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The FreeBSD developers are as concerned about security as they are
	about performance and stability.  FreeBSD includes kernel support for
	stateful IP firewalling, as well as other services, such as IP proxy
	gateways.</p>

      <p>FreeBSD also includes support for encryption software, secure
	shells, Kerberos authentication, "virtual servers" created using
	jails, chroot-ing services to restrict application access to the
	file system, Secure RPC facilities, and access lists for services
	that support TCP wrappers.</p>
