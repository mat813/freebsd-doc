<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>FreeBSD/xbox is a port of FreeBSD which aims to run on Microsoft&reg;
  Xbox&reg; systems.  This project was started by <a
  href="mailto:rink@FreeBSD.org">&a.rink;</a>, who did most of the patching
  and coding.  <a href="mailto:ed@fxq.nl">Ed Schouten</a> helped with
  reviewing patches and he also provided details on certain Xbox
  internals.</p>

<h3>Status</h3>

<p>FreeBSD/xbox is only supported in FreeBSD 7-CURRENT, and should still be
  considered experimental.  The framebuffer, Ethernet, sound and USB devices
  (such as an USB keyboard for the console) are all supported.</p>

<p>The new 7-CURRENT syscons(4)-capable console is available <a
  href="http://www.xbox-bsd.nl/patches/xbox-syscons.diff">here</a>.  Remember:
  you must remove /sys/i386/xbox/xboxfb.c before applying this patch!</p>

<p>A new live/install CD is currently being developed.</p>
