<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>FreeBSD/xbox is a port of FreeBSD which aims to run on Microsoft&reg;
  Xbox&reg; systems.  This project was started by <a
  href="mailto:rink@FreeBSD.org">&a.rink;</a>, who did most of the patching
  and coding.  <a href="mailto:ed@fxq.nl">Ed Schouten</a> helped with
  reviewing patches and he also provided details on certain Xbox
  internals.</p>

<h3>Status</h3>

<p>FreeBSD/xbox is only supported in FreeBSD 7-CURRENT, and should still be
  considered experimental.  The framebuffer, Ethernet, sound and USB devices
  (such as an USB keyboard for the console) are all supported.</p>

<p>The new 7-CURRENT syscons(4)-capable console is available <a
  href="http://www.xbox-bsd.nl/patches/xbox-syscons.diff">here</a>.  Remember:
  you must remove /sys/i386/xbox/xboxfb.c before applying this patch!</p>

<p>A new live/install CD is currently being developed.</p>

<h3>Booting on FreeBSD-CURRENT kernels</h3>

<p>In order to boot FreeBSD 7-CURRENT from CVS, you must have an up-to-date
  version of the Linux/xbox BIOS, called Cromwell (failure will result in your
  kernel crashing immediately after loading).  This is only available using <a
  href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=54192">anonymous CVS</a>, so you
  must check out the Cromwell module and build it yourself.  Additional
  information about Cromwell can be found on the xbox-linux.org website.</p>

<p>In order for Cromwell to load the FreeBSD kernels from an UFS partition,
  you will also need <a
  href="http://rink.nu/downloads/patches/cromwell-ufs.diff">this patch</a>.</p>

<h3>Installing on the hard drive</h3>

<p>You can do an installation using the Live CD's, but you will need to do
  everything manually.  It is suggested to prepare your disk using an i386
  computer running FreeBSD, and set up the /boot/xboxlinux.cfg configuration
  file yourself, so Cromwell can determine which kernel to load.</p>
