<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>FreeBSD/xbox is a port of FreeBSD which aims to run on Microsoft&reg;
  Xbox&reg; systems.  This project was started by <a
  href="mailto:rink@FreeBSD.org">&a.rink;</a>, who did most of the patching
  and coding.  <a href="mailto:ed@fxq.nl">Ed Schouten</a> helped with
  reviewing patches and he also provided details on certain Xbox
  internals.</p>

<h3>Status</h3>

<p>FreeBSD/xbox is only supported in FreeBSD 7-CURRENT, and should still be
  considered experimental.  The framebuffer, Ethernet, sound and USB devices
  (such as an USB keyboard for the console) are all supported.</p>

<p>A new live/install CD is currently being developed.</p>

<h3>Booting FreeBSD-CURRENT kernels</h3>

<p>In order to boot FreeBSD 7-CURRENT from CVS, you must have an up-to-date
  version of the Linux/xbox BIOS, called Cromwell (failure will result in your
  kernel crashing immediately after loading).  A Cromwell with FreeBSD UFS
  patches (this will make it able to load a kernel directly from an UFS file
  system) is available in the ports tree at /usr/ports/sysutils/cromwell; it
  can be flashed to the EEPROM using the /usr/ports/sysutils/raincoat port (as
  long as your Xbox is below version 1.6).</p>

<h3>Installing on the hard drive</h3>

<p>You can do an installation using the Live CD's, but you will need to do
  everything manually.  It is suggested to prepare your disk using an FreeBSD/i386
  installation and set up the /boot/xboxlinux.cfg configuration
  file yourself, so Cromwell can determine which kernel to load.</p>
