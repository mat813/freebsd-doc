    <p>FreeBSD/ARM is a port of FreeBSD which aims to run
      on the ARM architecture and hardware.
      The project's goal is to provide support for the
      architecture and hardware surrounding it.</p>

    <h3>FreeBSD/ARM Hardware Notes</h3>
    
    <p>Currently FreeBSD should work on the i80321 based Intel
      devboards, which includes the IQ31244 and IQ80321 boards.
      Support is still minimal, covering only the CPU, PCI-X bus,
      em(4) Ethernet adapters, the UART and timer devices.</p>

    <p>Minimal support for the StrongARM 1100 CPU is provided, but
      only within the limits of what Simics emulate: CPU,  UART and
      clock.  It is theoretically possible to boot on the Assabet board,
      the one Simics emulates; no attempts, successful or unsuccessful,
      have been reported.

    <h3>What Needs To Be Done</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>SATA support needs to be added.</li>

      <li>Other devices, such as watchdog, i2c and bus should be merged
        from NetBSD.</li>
    </ul>
