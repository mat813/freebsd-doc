  <h3><a name="history">Port History</a></h3>

  <p>The FreeBSD/SPARC port was initiated by Jason Evans in 1997.
    Originally, the port was backed by Sun Microelectronics, but they
    have since backed out.  This is quite interesting, given <a
    href="http://www.sun.com/smi/Press/sunflash/1999-12/sunflash.991214.1.html">this
    press release</a> from Sun, which announces that RedHat Linux 6.1
    can now be purchased and shipped with a new UltraSPARC server or
    workstation.  Sun joined Linux International in May 1998, shortly
    after Jason announced that he would no longer be working on the port
    in an official capacity.  Jordan Hubbard, the FreeBSD release
    engineer, responded to <a
    href="http://docs.freebsd.org/cgi/getmsg.cgi?fetch=0+0+archive/1998/freebsd-sparc/19980405.freebsd-sparc">Jason's
    post</a> suggesting that somebody needed to take the reins.</p>

  <p>FreeBSD/SPARC didn't die, however disheartening the news of Sun's
    retreat was.  The mailing list did go on hiatus for a while while
    several people working on coding.  Late in October 1998, a source
    code tarball was made available.</p>

  <p>Paolo Di Francesco was the next "father" of the port.  Paolo
    attempted, for the first time in the history of the port, to
    organize information, developers, and tasks into a structure that
    can only be known as project management.  If not for the 98-99
    holiday season and a few overspoken individuals on the mailing list,
    Paolo would have continued on.  During his tenure, a number of
    people stepped up to work on the older Sun SPARC architectures.
    This did cause a slight chasm in the project, and many of the more
    qualified individuals were on the side of the UltraSPARC family of
    machines.  Luckily, this didn't end up a period of quiet on the
    mailing list, as Telecom Italia provided us wit a list keep-alive.
    A glitch in their system caused one of Paolo's posts to keep coming
    back and back and back and back... This repeat post continued well
    into 1999, when the list did once again become mostly silent.</p>

  <p>This brings us up-to-date.  David O'Brien had been itching for a
    long time to start work on the port, but was waiting for some sort
    of direction.  As the months dragged on into 2000, he decided that
    nobody was going to accept the challenge if he didn't.  As to the
    port status, nothing much has changed since the early boot code
    release of October 1998.  The rest of the port history is best
    expressed by Jason Evans, and can be found <a
    href="#status">here</a>.</p>

  <p>The SPARC port is in it's infancy.  We've done a good bit of
    research into what needs to be done in order to make FreeBSD/SPARC a
    reality, but the vast majority of the work has yet to be done.</p>

  <p>Here's a short history of what led up to this porting effort.  Sun
    Microelectronics (SME) is the part of Sun that makes
    microprocessors.  Up until now, SMCC (the part of Sun that makes
    workstations) has been the overwhelmingly primary customer of SME.
    SME naturally wants to expand its sales, and to do that, they need
    to sell CPUs to people outside of Sun.  FreeBSD is perceived as
    being a way of accomplishing this.</p>

  <p>To understand why Sun could fund a FreeBSD port, which would seem
    to conflict with Sun's Solaris offerings, you need to realize that
    Sun is broken up into separate business units that often
    <strong>compete</strong> with each other.  The Solaris people at Sun
    may not like having a FreeBSD port to compete with, but their power
    to prevent it is somewhat diminished due to the business model.  Of
    course, if the FreeBSD port were a major threat, SMI (the main Sun
    umbrella company) would put a stop to it.  However, this is
    unlikely, since FreeBSD mostly meets the needs of a different market
    sector than Solaris.  Solaris does wonderful things on big MP
    servers.  FreeBSD is fast and lean for small servers.  It is also
    useful for certain types of embedded applications, which is actually
    the main reason SME is interested in seeing a port of FreeBSD to
    SPARC.</p>

  <p>A while back, SME approached the FreeBSD core team and offered
    monetary compensation of some nature (I don't know the details) in
    exchange for an official UltraSPARC port.  The core team turned down
    this offer.  Once again, I don't know details, but one of the main
    statements made (actually somewhat inferred) by Jordan Hubbard was
    that SME's offer was not of major interest since to be of long term
    use to FreeBSD, such a proposal would need to include support for a
    number of years from someone internal to Sun.</p>

  <p>Jordan's statement makes a great deal of sense.  I've traced down
    documentation in preparation for this port that people external to
    Sun would have had a difficult, perhaps impossible time procuring.
    Without such access, it is very difficult to make continual progress
    on such a project.</p>

  <p>Now it's time to mingle some of my background into this narrative.
    I started working at SME in September of 1997.  During my first
    week, I caught wind of the negotiations SME was making with the core
    team.  I expressed extreme interest in working on the project.
    Through a bit of persistence (and the failure of the proposal made
    by SME), I was given permission to begin work on the port.</p>

  <p>My other duties at SME include finding information for software
    vendors who are porting their OSes/RTOSes to the UltraSPARC.  This
    puts me in a good position to gather hardware information pertinent
    to the FreeBSD port.</p>

  <p>So here's the catch.  I have access to documentation, a machine to
    develop on, but very little low-level OS or hardware experience.  I
    learn quickly, but I've got a lot to learn.  Already several people
    have been able to help me grasp concepts that are key to porting
    FreeBSD, but there is much, much more to learn.</p>

  <p>So, I can use the following types of help (not exclusively, of
    course:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Answer my questions about kernel and hardware details.  For
      example, I have documentation on the MMU, but have never actually
      dealt with one, so John Dyson has volunteered to get me through
      the rough spots having to do with memory management, as well as
      discussing design issues due to the difference in nature between
      PCs and Suns.</li>

    <li>Actually write code.</li>

    <li>Various administrative things, such as a web page, bug tracking,
      FAQ, etc.</li>

    <li>Whatever you can do to help.</li>

  <h3><a name="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</a></h3>

  <ol>
    <li><a href="#1">What happened to the old FAQ?</a></li>
    <li><a href="#2">What is the status of the port?</a></li>
    <li><a href="#3">What machines will FreeBSD/SPARC run on?</a></li>
    <li><a href="#4">Does FreeBSD/SPARC support device X?</a></li>
    <li><a href="#5">Will FreeBSD/SPARC run Solaris/SunOS binaries?</a></li>
  </ol>

  <h4><a name="1">What happened to the old FAQ?</a></h4>

  <p>It's right <a
    href="http://people.FreeBSD.org/~obrien/freebsd-sparc/oldfaq.html">here</a>.
    The old FAQ is SME-centeric, and sun4u-specific.  These traits do
    not reflect the current state of the port, since SME has pulled
    their official support from the port and the majority of the
    development equipment now consists of older Sun SPARC hardware.
    Furthermore, there haven't been a lot of frequently asked questions
    of late.  Most of the items in the old FAQ date back to before the
    mailing list was being archived.</p>

  <h4><a name="2">What is the status of the port?</a></h4>

  <p>While we're in the early stages, and to help keep people interested
    in the porting effort, you can view the <a href="#status">status</a>
    online.</p>

  <h4><a name="3">What machines will FreeBSD/SPARC run on?</a></h4>

  <p>Currently?  None.  The port is a long way away from running on
    anything.  We have plans to support every machine we can.  It is
    safe to assume that FreeBSD/SPARC will run on at least all the
    machines that OpenBSD and NetBSD run on.  This includes sun4, sun4c,
    sun4m, and sun4u.</p>

  <h4><a name="4">Does FreeBSD/SPARC support device X?</a></h4>

  <p>See <a href="#3">question #3</a>.</p>

  <h4><a name="5">Will FreeBSD/SPARC run Solaris/SunOS binaries?</a></h4>

  <p>It is reasonable to say that FreeBSD/SPARC will provide some
    Solaris/SunOS emulation.  It is too early in the life of the port to
    answer this any more specifically.</p>
