  <h3><a name="history">Port History</a></h3>

  <p>The FreeBSD/sparc64 platform port was initiated by Jason Evans in
    1997.  Originally, the port was backed by Sun Microelectronics.  Sun
    Microelectronics (SME) is the part of Sun that makes
    microprocessors.  Up until now, SMCC (the part of Sun that makes
    workstations) has been the overwhelmingly primary customer of SME.
    SME naturally wants to expand its sales, and to do that, they need
    to sell CPUs to people outside of Sun.  FreeBSD was perceived as
    being a way of accomplishing this.</p>

  <p>To understand why Sun could fund a FreeBSD port, which would seem
    to conflict with Sun's Solaris offerings, you need to realize that
    Sun is broken up into separate business units that often
    <strong>compete</strong> with each other.  The Solaris people at
    Sun may not like having a FreeBSD port to compete with, but their
    power to prevent it is somewhat diminished due to the business
    model.  Of course, if the FreeBSD port were a major threat, SMI
    (the main Sun umbrella company) would put a stop to it.  However,
    this is unlikely, since FreeBSD mostly meets the needs of a
    different market sector than Solaris.  Solaris does wonderful
    things on big MP servers.  FreeBSD is fast and lean for small
    servers.  It is also useful for certain types of embedded
    applications, which is actually the main reason SME is interested
    in seeing a port of FreeBSD to UltraSPARC.</p>

  <p>A while back, SME approached the FreeBSD core team and offered
    monetary compensation of some nature in exchange for an official
    UltraSPARC port.  The core team turned down this offer.  The exact
    reasons are known only to the core team, but Jordan Hubbard
    implied taht SME's offer was not of major interest since to be of
    long term use to FreeBSD, such a proposal would need to include
    support for a number of years from someone internal to Sun.</p>

  <p>Jason Evans started working at SME in September of 1997. During
    the first week, he caught wind of the negotiations SME was making
    with the core team.  Jason expressed extreme interest in working
    on the project.  Through a bit of persistence (and the failure of
    the proposal made by SME), he was given permission to begin work
    on the port.</p>

  <p>Jason's other duties SME included finding information for
    software vendors who are porting their OSes/RTOSes to the
    UltraSPARC.  This put him in a good position to gather hardware
    information pertinent to the FreeBSD port.</p>

  <p>Jason was instrumental in getting the FreeBSD/sparc64 port done,
    and doing much of the initial planning.  Sun Microsystems has
    since backed out of their support for the FreeBSD/sparc64 effort,
    and Jason Evans eventually left Sun.</p>

  <p>Paolo Di Francesco was the next "father" of the port.  Paolo
    attempted, for the first time in the history of the port, to
    organize information, developers, and tasks into a structure that
    can only be known as project management.  If not for the 98-99
    holiday season and a few overspoken individuals on the mailing list,
    Paolo would have continued on.  During his tenure, a number of
    people stepped up to work on the older Sun SPARC architectures.
    This did cause a slight chasm in the project, and many of the more
    qualified individuals were on the side of the UltraSPARC family of
    machines.  Luckily, this didn't end up a period of quiet on the
    mailing list, as Telecom Italia provided us with a list keep-alive.
    A glitch in their system caused one of Paolo's posts to keep coming
    back and back and back and back... This repeat post continued well
    into 1999, when the list did once again become mostly silent.</p>

  <p>In 2000, Jake Burkholder and Thomas Moestl have made an
    incredible amount of work on the sparc port.  Most of the
    development has taken place in the Perforce repository on
    freefall, and has only been merged to the HEAD (-CURRENT branch)
    of CVS after more careful testing.  David O'Brien has done a lot
    of work to provide a usable toolchain for FreeBSD/sparc64
    development.  Until one of the above mentioned people updates this
    paragraph, please see the mailing list archives. ;)</p>

  <h3><a name="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</a></h3>

  <ol>
    <li><a href="#1">What happened to the old FAQ?</a></li>
    <li><a href="#2">What is the status of the port?</a></li>
    <li><a href="#3">What machines will FreeBSD/sparc64 run on?</a></li>
    <li><a href="#4">Does FreeBSD/sparc64 support device X?</a></li>
    <li><a href="#5">Will FreeBSD/sparc64 run Solaris/SunOS binaries?</a></li>
  </ol>

  <h4><a name="1">What happened to the old FAQ?</a></h4>

  <p>It's right <a
    href="http://people.FreeBSD.org/~obrien/freebsd-sparc/oldfaq.html">here</a>.
    The old FAQ is SME-centeric, and sun4u-specific.  These traits do
    not reflect the current state of the port, since SME has pulled
    their official support from the port and the majority of the
    development equipment now consists of older Sun SPARC hardware.
    Furthermore, there haven't been a lot of frequently asked questions
    of late.  Most of the items in the old FAQ date back to before the
    mailing list was being archived.</p>

  <h4><a name="2">What is the status of the port?</a></h4>

  <p>It is possible to boot a number of newer UltraSparc hardware
    platforms into FreeBSD with time and patience.  Please see the <a
    href="&base;/relnotes/CURRENT/hardware/sparc64/index.html">FreeBSD/sparc64
    Hardware Notes</a> for more information.</p>

  <h4><a name="3">What machines will FreeBSD/sparc64 run on?</a></h4>

  <p>Please see the <a
    href="&base;/relnotes/CURRENT/hardware/sparc64/index.html">FreeBSD/sparc64
    Hardware Notes</a> for more information.</p>

  <h4><a name="4">Does FreeBSD/sparc64 support device X?</a></h4>

  <p>See <a href="#3">question #3</a>.</p>

  <h4><a name="5">Will FreeBSD/sparc64 run Solaris/SunOS binaries?</a></h4>

  <p>It is reasonable to say that FreeBSD/sparc64 will provide some
    Solaris/SunOS emulation.  It is too early in the life of the port to
    answer this any more specifically.</p>
