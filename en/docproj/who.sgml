    <p>The project is a fairly loosely knit group of people, and the only thing
      we have got in common is that we are subscribed to the mailing list
      <a href="mailto:FreeBSD-doc@FreeBSD.ORG">FreeBSD-doc@FreeBSD.ORG</a>.</p>

    <p>Some of us can commit changes directly to the FreeBSD documentation
      tree. The complete list of people with commit ``privs'' is in <a
	href="../handbook/staff-doc.html">the
	Handbook</a>.</p>
    
    <p>Others do not have commit privs, but they write and <a
	href="submitting.html">submit documentation</a> nonetheless. One of the
      committers will then include it in the documentation set.</p>
    
    <p>If you want to help out with the documentation project (and I fervently
      hope you do) all you have to do is subscribe to the mailing list and
      participate. As soon as you have done that you're a member of the
      project.</p>
