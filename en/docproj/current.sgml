    &header;
    
    <p>Here are the projects currently under way (or being actively
      contemplated on the freebsd-doc mailing list). I have also included some
      that have not really been talked about, but would probably be a
      good idea. Each project lists the  contact person for that
      project (if I know who it is).</p>

    <p>If you think you can contribute to any of these, please do not
      hesitate to stand up and be counted. You should talk to the
      person responsible for that particular project, who can then bring you
      up to speed on what is happening.</p>

    <p>Any ommissions in this list are entirely my fault (Nik Clayton,
      &lt;<a href="mailto:nik@FreeBSD.ORG">nik@FreeBSD.ORG</a>&gt;), sorry
      in advance to anyone whose project I have missed.</p>

    <h3><font color="#660000">FreeBSD for Linux users</font></h3>

    <p><b>Responsible:</b> Annelise Anderson &lt;andrsn@andrsn.stanford.edu&gt;</p>

    <p><b>Synopsis:</b> Linux users coming to FreeBSD can be confused by 
      some of the differences between the systems (the different default
      shells, how boot time configuration is performed, and so on). Annelise
      is coordinating the development of a tutorial/FAQ section that will
      address these points.</p>

    <p>The list of current questions is at <a href="http://freebsd.stanford.edu/FreeBSD/linux.html">http://freebsd.stanford.edu/FreeBSD/linux.html</a>.</p> 

    <h3><font color="#660000">Fixup the FOO.TXT files</font></h3>

    <p><b>Responsible:</b> Doug &lt;studded@dal.net&gt;</p>

    <p><b>Synopsis:</b> The "FOO.TXT" files are the README files, the
      INSTALL.TXTs.  the ABOUT.TXTs and so on that you get with FreeBSD. Doug
      (and others) are going through these trying to make sure they are
      accurate, consistent, and easy to understand. A very worthwhile task.</p>
    
    <h3><font color="#660000">Migrate the Handbook from LinuxDoc to DocBook</font></h3>

    <p><b>Responsible:</b> Nik Clayton &lt;nik@freebsd.org&gt;</p>
    
    <p><b>Synopsis:</b> The FreeBSD Handbook is being migrated from the
      LinuxDoc DTD to the DocBook DTD. Along the way a few wrinkles are being
      bumped into, particularly involving TeX. A plan has been drawn up,
      preparatory work has been done, but it will be a few weeks before it is
      finished.</p>

    <h3><font color="#660000">Write a section in the Handbook and/or FAQ</font></h3>

    <p><b>Responsible:</b> No one</p>

    <p><b>Synopsis:</b> Chunks of the FAQ and Handbook have empty sections in
      them. They need filling. If you have just had to use one of
      these documents to complete a task, and found them lacking,
      please find the time to write up your experiences as a
      possible replacement.</p>
      
    <p>Alternatively, if you have just had to do something that had no
      entry in the FAQ and/or Handbook, please consider writing a
      new section. Then submit it as outlined above.</p>
      
    <h3><font color="#660000">Write the "This is how the Handbook is made" document</font></h3>

    <p><b>Responsible:</b> No one (although I can offer assistance)</p>

    <p><b>Synopsis:</b> The mechanism used to put the constituent parts of the
      Handbook together to make the HTML, Postscript, and plain
      text versions is not particularly well documented. If you want
      to learn how this process works, and want to document it as
      well, please get in touch.</p>
      
    <p>You will be doing everyone else a big favour, because it then
      makes it much easier for people to contribute documentation
      that can just slot into the Handbook.</p>
    
    <h3><font color="#660000">Rewrite the Handbook :-)</font></h3>

    <p><b>Responsible:</b> No one, yet</p>

    <p><b>Synopsis:</b> The Handbook has grown quite organically over the
      past few years. This means some of the sections are not organised as
      well as they could be, and some of it needs reworking.</p>

    <p>Someone needs to</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Read the Handbook thoroughly</li>
      <li>Come up with a revised structure for it</li>
      <li>Understand how the Handbook is implemented (this will
	mean learning some stuff about SGML, and probably
	liasing with the DocBook migration project)</li>
      <li>Actually do the rework.</li>
    </ul>
      
    <p>To break this into manageable chunks, it would be really handy 
      if someone could first maintain a web page that lists people's 
      current comments about the Handbook structure. That would at
      least give us all something to work from.</p>
    
    <p>If no one steps forward to handle this I am going to do
      it. It will just take me a while to get to it (since I need to
      get the DocBook migration out of the way first).</p>

<h3><font color="#660000">Write some new Papers</font></h3>

<h3><font color="#660000">CGI Scripts</font></h3>
    <p><b>Responsible:</b> 
     &lt;<a href="mailto:doc@freebsd.org">doc@freebsd.org</a>,
     Wolfram Schneider &lt;<a href="mailto:wosch@freebsd.org">
     wosch@freebsd.org</a>
     <p><b>Synopsis:</b> 
     <ul>
     <li>Rewrite cvsweb.cgi cgi script from scratch using a
     RCS perl Module</li>
     <li>Rewrite man.cgi cgi script and fix some bugs.</li>
     <li>Write a ports INDEX perl Module. 
     </ul>

     <h3>Here are some hints how to write the ports module</h3>

	<h4>A single line in /usr/ports/INDEX looks like</h4>

	<pre>
   xfig-3.2.2|/usr/ports/graphics/xfig|/usr/X11R6|A drawing program for X11|/usr/ports/graphics/xfig/pkg/DESCR|ports@FreeBSD.ORG|graphics x11|XFree86-3.3.2 Xaw3d-1.3 jpeg-6b xpm-3.4k|XFree86-3.3.2 Xaw3d-1.3 jpeg-6b netpbm-94.3.1 tiff-3.4 transfig-3.2 xpm-3.4k
        </pre>

	<h4>The format is</h4>

	<pre>
   distribution-name|port-path|installation-prefix|comment| \
       description-file|maintainer|categories|build deps|run deps
       </pre>

       <h4>The above INDEX line parsed into an anonymous hash object</h4>

       <pre>
$port = {	
	DISTRIBUTION_NAME   => 'xfig-3.2.2',
	PORT_PATH           => '/usr/ports/graphics/xfig',
	INSTALLATION_PREFIX => '/usr/X11R6',
	COMMENT             => 'A drawing program for X11',
	DESCRIPTION_FILE    => '/usr/ports/graphics/xfig/pkg/DESCR',
	MAINTAINER          => 'ports@FreeBSD.ORG',
	CATEGORIES          => ['graphics', 'x11'],
	BUILD_DEPS          => ['XFree86-3.3.2', 'Xaw3d-1.3', 'jpeg-6b', 
	                        'xpm-3.4k'],
	RUN_DEPS            => ['XFree86-3.3.2',  'Xaw3d-1.3', 'jpeg-6b',
				'netpbm-94.3.1', 'tiff-3.4', 'transfig-3.2',
				'xpm-3.4k'] 
};
      </pre>

      <h4>Now we need some functions</h4>

      <ul>
      <li>Print a $port object as HTML output
      <li>Print a $port object as ASCII output
      <li>Find all objects which are maintained by user XYZ
      <li>Find all objects which are in category XYZ
      <li>Find all objects which run/build depend on port XYZ
      <li>Find all objects which match the string XYZ in DISTRIBUTION_NAME
        or COMMENT
      <li>Sort objects by DISTRIBUTION_NAME 
      </ul>

      <h4>Finally</h4> 

      <p>Modify the cgi script url.cgi, ports.cgi , pds.cgi and the
      script portindex to use this module.
