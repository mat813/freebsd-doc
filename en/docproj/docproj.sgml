    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>Getting to grips with a new and complex operating system is always a
      difficult task, no matter how pretty the GUI is. FreeBSD is no different 
      in this respect.</p>

    <p>While there are a vast number of BSD Unix (and general Unix) books
      available, FreeBSD has its own unique features, procedures and
      quirks.</p>

    <p>In addition, FreeBSD will be the first exposure to a Unix-like
      operating system for many of its users, so the availability of high
      quality, accurate documentation is paramount.</p>

    <p>The FreeBSD Documentation Project exists to help fill this gap. There
      are two ways in which this is undertaken;</p>

    <ol>
      <li><p>Members of the Documentation Project write documentation and
	  submit it for inclusion in the <em>FreeBSD Documentation
	    Set</em>.</p></li>

      <li><p>Members of the Documentation Project discuss and arrange the
	  formatting and organisation of the <em>FreeBSD Documentation
	    Set</em>.</p></li>
    </ol>

      <tr>
	<td><h2 align="center"><a href="docproj/current.html">Current
	      projects</a></h2>
	  
	  <p>There are a number of projects currently <em>in progress</em> as
	    part of the documentation effort. Please take the time to look over
	    this list and see if there is anything <b>you</b> can help
	    with.</p></td>

    <h2><a href="docproj/who.html">Who we are, how to join</a></h2>

    <p>This page explains who makes up the Documentation Project, and how
      you can join.</p>

    <h2><a href="docproj/doc-set.html">The FreeBSD Documentation Set</a></h2>

    <p>This page outlines the components of the FreeBSD Documentation Set, and 
      the sort of work that the Documentation Project does with them.</p>

    <h2><a href="docproj/sgml.html">SGML and the Documentation Project</a></h2>

    <p>The project is trying to use SGML for the documentation. This page
      outlines how this is accomplished, and directs the interested reader to
      further SGML resources.</p>

    <h2><a href="docproj/submitting.html">Submitting Documentation</a></h2>

    <p>Submitting documentation is the best way to become a part of the
      project, and help make FreeBSD easier to use. This page explains the
      best way to submit documentation so that it gets looked at as soon as
      possible.</p>
