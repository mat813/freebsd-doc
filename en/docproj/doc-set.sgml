    <p>FreeBSD's documentation falls into four basic categories;</p>

    <ol>
      <li><p><b>The manual pages</b></p>

	<p>The Project does not really concern itself with these, since
	  they are a part of the base system. The exception to this is the
	  Japanese team, who are translating them. There is no reason other
	  volunteers could not step in to translate the manual pages to other
	  languages as well.</p>

	<p>That is not to say that the manual pages are unimportant, far from
	  it. It is just that they are intimately tied to specific systems of
	  FreeBSD, and most of the time the best person to write the manual
	  page is the person that wrote that part of FreeBSD.</p></li>

      <li><p><b>The FAQ</b></p>

	<p>This is maintained by the project. The aim is to address (in short
	  question and answer format) questions that are asked or should be
	  asked on the various mailing lists and newsgroups devoted to
	  FreeBSD. The format does not permit long winded and comprehensive
	  answers.</p></li>

      <li><p><b>The Handbook</b></p>

	<p>This is maintained by the project. Topics that need a more in depth 
	  discussion are addressed in the Handbook.</p></li>

      <li><p><b>The Tutorials</b></p>

	<p>Some of these tutorials are maintained by Project committers, others
	  are not. The <b>maintenance</b> of these documents is up to the
	  individual authors, although, to the best of my knowledge,
	  they have all kept them up to date, solicit comments from the
	  readership and so on.</p>

	<p>Some of the tutorials are stored on the FreeBSD web site. For these
	  tutorials the authors submit their changes to one of the committers,
	  and the committer makes the change. Other tutorials are stored on the
	  author's private webspace, and the author can make changes as and
	  when they wish. Sometimes this is a deliberate choice on the part
	  of the author, and sometimes it is a historical accident.</p></li>
