	  <p>Below is a list of known issues with GNOME &gnomever; that are 
	    specific to FreeBSD.  These are not the only known issues,
	    however.  Please familiarize yourself with the GNOME &gnomever;
	    <a href="http://www.gnome.org/start/&gnomever;/notes/">
	    release notes</a> which contains a 
	    <a href="http://www.gnome.org/start/&gnomever;/notes/rnknownissues.html">
	    list</a> of known issues that affect all platforms.</p>

	  <h3>1. evolution has a problem with attachments under GNOME &gnomever;</h3>

	    <p> evolution-1.4.4 has a problem with attachments under
	       GNOME &gnomever;. This will be fixed in Evo 1.4.5 due out shortly.
	    </p>

	  <h3>2. gstreamer doesn't play nice with rhythmbox</h3>

	    <p> gstreamer-0.6.3  doesn't play nice with rhythmbox. It is
	      recommended you build rhythmbox with the libxine backend for
	      now.
	    </p>

	  <h3>3. GDM crashes on startup</h3>

	    <p>GDM may crash on startup, especially on 5.1-RELEASE and
	      earlier.  All GDM users need to copy 
	      <tt>/usr/X11R6/etc/gdm/factory-gdm.conf</tt> over
	      <tt>/usr/X11R6/etc/gdm/gdm.conf</tt>.  The old
	      config version from GNOME 2.2 will not work.  Users of 
	      5.1-RELEASE and earlier need to read the <tt>pkg-message</tt>
	      that comes with the GDM2 port/package on how to patch OpenPAM
	      to work with GDM2.</p>
