	  <p>Below are a list of known issues with GNOME 2.4 that are 
	    specific to FreeBSD.  They are not the only known issues,
	    however.  Please familiarize yourself with the GNOME 2.4
	    <a href="http://www.gnome.org/start/2.4/notes/">
	    release notes</a> which contains a 
	    <a href="http://www.gnome.org/start/2.4/notes/rnknownissues.html">
	    list</a> of known issues that affect all platforms.</p>

	  <h3>1. evolution has a problem with attachments under GNOME 2.4</h3>

	    <p> evolution-1.4.4 has a problem with attachments under
	       GNOME 2.4. This will be fixed in Evo 1.4.5 due out shortly.
	    </p>

	  <h3>2. gstreamer doesn't play nice with rhythmbox</h3>

	    <p> gstreamer-0.6.3  doesn't play nice with rhythmbox. It is
	      recommended you build rhtymbox with the libxine backend for
	      now.
	    </p>

	  <h3>3. GDM crashes on startup</h3>

	    <p>GDM may crash on startup especially on 5.1-RELEASE and
	      earlier.  All gdm users need to copy the
	      <tt>factory-gdm.conf</tt> over the <tt>gdm.conf</tt>.  The old
	      config version from GNOME 2.2 will not work.  Users of 
	      5.1-RELEASE and earlier need to read the <tt>pkg-message</tt>
	      that comes with the gdm2 port/package on how to patch OpenPAM
	      to work with gdm2.</p>
