          <h2>1. What to report?</h2>

          <p>The rule of the thumb should be: report as much information as you
            can, because even if there is some irrelevant information usually
	    developers could quite easy filter it out.  On contrary, situation is
	    much worse when there is too little informaton to reliably track down
	    or reproduce the problem - in this case developers have to speend their
	    time guessing and/or asking originator of report to send more
	    information.</p>

          <p>There are plenty of examples of totally useless bug reports, something
            like <i>"Hey, gnomefoo port is broken.  I'm running FreeBSD-X.Y.
	    Please fix."</i> Nedless to say, that such report is just a waste of
	    your time, time of the appropriate developer and network bandwidth.
	    At the bare minimum the report should include the following
	    information:</p>

          <ul>
	    <li><p>Exact version of the operating system (usually output of
	      <tt>uname -a</tt>).</p></li>
	    <li><p>List of all packages installed on your system.</p></li>
	    <li><p>Your environment (output of <tt>/usr/bin/env</tt>).
	    <li><p>If you are building from ports then approximate time when you was
	      last time updating your ports tree.</p></li>
	    <li><p>Information specific for each type of breakage: full log of
	      unsuccessful build in the case when the build of the port is broken,
	      stack trace in the case of coredump, clean and detailed description
	      of the problem when application does something unexpected etc.  Try
	      to put yourself into developer's shoes and in each particular case
	      evaluate what information would be necessary for him to locate the
	      source of the problem, don't just assume that he alredy knows all
	      about the problem, but is just too lazy to fix it.</p></li>
          </ul>

          <p>If you have a solution or a workaround for the problem then include
            it into your report as well, even if you are not quite sure that this
	    is a correct fix, if it is not it could give developer idea about
	    what to look at and save him some time.</p>

          <h2>2. Where to report?</h2>

          <p>There are several ways to report a bug in GNOME running on a FreeBSD
            system: you could send report to the
	    <a href="mailto:freebsd-gnome@FreeBSD.org">freebsd-gnome mailing
	    list</a>, file a problem report in
	    <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/support.html#gnats">FreeBSD bug
	    reporting system</a>, send your report to the particular GNOME
	    developers via their
	    <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/">bug tracking system</a> or any
	    combination of those.<p>

          <p>It is impossible to define guidelines that will clearly tell you where
            to report in each particular case - you have to use your own common
	    sense, however some rules follow:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><p>If the problem is FreeBSD-specific and transient (e.g. checksum
	      mismatch, patch failure, syntax error in port's Makefile etc.) then
	      report to the freebsd-gnome mailing list.</p></li>
	    <li><p>If the problem is clearly not FreeBSD-specific and you have no
	      readily available solution then report to the developers of the
	      software directly (for most core GNOME components this means that you
	      need to use their Bugzilla bug tracking system).</p></li>
	    <li><p>If the proble isn't a FreeBSD-specific, but quite serious and you
	      have a fix available then report both to FreeBSD and authors' bug
	      tracking systems, so that the appropriate port will be patched and
	      other users of FreeBSD will be able to benefit from your fix, without
	      the need to wait for a next vendor's release.</p></li>
          </ul>
