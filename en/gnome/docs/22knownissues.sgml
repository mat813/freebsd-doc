          <h3>1. notification-area-applet crashes at logout</h3>

	    <p>If you have a notification area on one of your panels, 
	      you will receive a segfault when logging out.  Bug
	      <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=105421">
              105421</a> has been filed with GNOME Bugzilla.  There is no 
	      workaround other than not to use the notification area applet, 
	      or simply ignore the crash dialog.</p>

          <h3>2. Unable to use gst-thumbnail</h3>
	    
	    <p>If you try to use the gst-thumbnail application to 
	      thubmnail video files, you may encounter an error 
	      saying colorspace is not available.  You must rebuild
	      <tt>multimedia/gstreamer-plugins</tt> with Hermes 
	      support to correct this.  To do this, specify
	      <tt>-DWITH_HERMES</tt> when build <tt>gstreamer-plugins</tt>.

	  <h3>3. Wireless applet does not work</h3>

	    <p>The wireless monitoring applet does not work under
	      FreeBSD.  It relies on files in the Linux proc file
	      system that do not exist under FreeBSD (even under linprocfs).
	      Work is underway to add FreeBSD Aironet support to this
	      applet.  If you're interested in helping out, contact
	      <a href="mailto:marcus@FreeBSD.org">marcus@FreeBSD.org</a>.
	    </p>

	  <h3>4. gnomesystemmonitor does not display correct stats</h3>

	    <p>The gnomesystemmonitor may not list all processes or display
	      correct CPU or memory information under FreeBSD.  Patches
	      are needed to correct this problem.  If you are interested in
	      helping, please contact <a href="mailto:&email;@FreeBSD.org">
	      freebsd-gnome@FreeBSD.org</a>.
