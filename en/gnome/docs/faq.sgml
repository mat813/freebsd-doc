	    <p>There are two ways to install GNOME on FreeBSD.  One way is to use 
	      <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/packages-using.html">
	        packages</a>, and the other way is to use
	      <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/ports-using.html">
	        ports</a>.</p>

	    <p>To install GNOME from packages, use the command:</p>

	    <tt># pkg_add -r gnome</tt>

	    <p>This will download the latest GNOME packages from the FreeBSD FTP
	      site, and proceed to install them on your system.  <b>Note:</b> As
	      of 4.4-RELEASE, installing GNOME from packages contained on a
	      release CDROM is broken.  You should  instead use the ports
	      method below.  The problem was fixed in the 4.5-RELEASE.</p>

	    <p>To build and install GNOME from ports, you should first 
	      <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/cvsup.html">
	        cvsup</a> the latest ports tree.  Then:</p>

	    <pre>
# cd /usr/ports/x11/gnome
# make clean
# make install clean
	    </pre>

		<p>After installing GNOME, you might consider adding the following
		  to <tt>/etc/make.conf</tt>:</p>

		<pre>
WITH_GTK=yes
        </pre>

		<p>This is an optional step, but will allow certain ports, such as
		  Vim, to take advantage of the Gtk+ widget set.</p>

	    <p>Currently, building from ports is the preferred method for
	      installing GNOME on FreeBSD, however FreeBSD GNOME team is working
	      on improving situation with pre-built packages.</p>

	    <p>The majority of GNOME compilation problems can be solved by making
	      sure all the necessary GNOME components are up-to-date.  All GNOME
	      applications require the following core components to build:</p>

	    <pre>
pkg-config
glib
gettext
gtk+
ORBit
Imlib
esound
gnomelibs
gnomecore
            </pre>

	    <p>Verify all those components are up-to-date, then try building
	      GNOME or your GNOME application again.  You may see compiler errors
	      relating to pthreads (POSIX threads), such as:</p>

	    <pre>
undefined reference to 'strerror_r'
            </pre>

	    <p>To fix thread related errors, make sure you have the following
	      compiled into your kernel:</p>

	    <pre>
options     P1003_1B
options     _KPOSIX_PRIORITY_SCHEDULING
            </pre>

	    <p>And make sure if you're tracking -stable or -current, that you
	      do <b>not</b> have <tt>NOLIBC_R</tt> set in <tt>/etc/make.conf</tt>.
	      If you do, remove it, then rebuild world.  If you still have trouble,
	      please send email to <a href="mailto:&email;@FreeBSD.ORG">
	      &email;@FreeBSD.ORG</a> with the output of the failed compilation.
	    </p>

		<p>Ports such as <tt>devel/pth</tt> and <tt>devel/ngpt</tt> can
		  also cause pthread-related problems when compiling GNOME.  If you
		  do not need these ports installed, it is recommended you remove them.

	    <p>Short answer is you can.  The problem is most likely that you
	      have Launch Feedback (xalf) enabled.  xalf is a FreeBSD shared
	      object, and as such cannot be loaded by Linux applications.
	      When you try to load a Linux application, nothing will happen,
	      and something like the following will show up in
	      <tt>~/.gnomerc-errors</tt> or on stdout:</p>

	    <pre>
/usr/local/Acrobat4/Reader/intellinux/bin/acroread: error in loading shared 
libraries: /usr/X11R6/lib/libxalflaunch.so.0: ELF file OS ABI invalid.
	    </pre>

	    <p>To fix this problem you need to install the 
		  <tt>linux-xalf</tt> port.  This port (or package) installs
		  the Linux version of <tt>libxalflaunch.so.0</tt> in 
		  <tt>/compat/linux/usr/X11R6/lib</tt>, and will be used 
		  instead of the FreeBSD binary when launching Linux 
		  applications.  You may see the following error after installing

/usr/libexec/ld-elf.so.1: Shared object "libkrb.so.3" not found
