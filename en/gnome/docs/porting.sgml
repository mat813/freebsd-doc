<p>General instructions can be found in the <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/porters-handbook/index.html">FreeBSD Porter's Handbook</a>.
<p>For ports that <i>require</i> GNOME, you should define the following in your
port's Makefile:</p>

<pre>
USE_GNOME=	yes
USE_X_PREFIX=	yes
</pre>

<p>These will take care of the install prefix and requiring all the core GNOME
dependencies.  If your port can use GNOME, but it isn't required, you can 
define the following in your Makefile:</p>

<pre>
WANT_GNOME=	yes
</pre>

<p>If the user has defined <tt>WITH_GNOME</tt> in their <tt>/etc/make.conf</tt>
then GNOME components will be built.  Other useful GNOME-related macros
that can be define in your port's Makefile include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><tt>USE_GLIB (WANT_GLIB)</tt> : The application requires (can use) Glib.
Defining <tt>USE_GNOME</tt> or <tt>USE_GTK</tt> takes care of this option
automatically.</p></li>
<li><p><tt>USE_GTK (WANT_GTK)</tt> : The application may not be GNOME-compliant, but
requires GTK+ widgets.  This will take care of those dependencies.  Note, this
option should <b>not</b> be defined if <tt>USE_GNOME</tt> is defined.</p></li>
<li><p><tt>USE_ESOUND (WANT_ESOUND)</tt> : The application requires (can use) 
Esound.  Normally, Esound support is added by specifying <tt>USE_GNOME</tt>.
</p></li>
<li><p><tt>USE_IMLIB (WANT_IMLIB)</tt> : The application requires (can use) the 
Imlib image library.  This is not needed if <tt>USE_GNOME</tt> is defined.
</p></li>
<li><p><tt>USE_GNOMELIBS (WANT_GNOMELIBS)</tt> : The application requires (can use)
GNOME libraries.  This does not import as many dependencies as
<tt>USE_GNOME</tt> and should be used for applications that use GNOME, but 
do not need the GNOME Control Center, the GNOME capplet library, or 
anything from the GNOME Core.</p></li>
<li><p><tt>USE_GNOMECTRL (WANT_GNOMECTRL)</tt> : The application requires 
(can use) all the GNOME libraries and the GNOME Control Center, but does not 
use anything from GNOME Core.  This option is usually used for backend APIs.
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The more ported applications we have, the better.
