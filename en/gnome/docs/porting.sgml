          <p>This document assumes that you already know how port system works,
	    and therefore only provides GNOME-specific hints and tips.  General
	    instructions can be found in the 
	    <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/porters-handbook/index.html">FreeBSD Porter's Handbook</a>.

	  <h2>GNOME Makefile Macros</h2>
          <p>For ports that <i>require</i> GNOME, you should define the following
	    in your port's Makefile:</p>

          <pre>
USE_GNOME=	yes
USE_X_PREFIX=	yes
          </pre>

          <p>These will take care of the install prefix and requiring all the 
	    core GNOME dependencies.  If your port can use GNOME, but it isn't 
	    required, you can define the following in your Makefile:</p>

          <pre>
WANT_GNOME=	yes
          </pre>

          <p>If the ports system detects GNOME installed on the system
	    then GNOME components will be built.  Other useful GNOME-related 
		macros that can be define in your port's Makefile include:</p>

<!-- Begin GNOME-related Makefile macros -->
          <ul>
            <li><p><tt>USE_GLIB (WANT_GLIB)</tt> : The application requires 
	      (can use) Glib.  Defining <tt>USE_GNOME</tt> or <tt>USE_GTK</tt> 
	      takes care of this option automatically.</p></li>

            <li><p><tt>USE_GTK (WANT_GTK)</tt> : The application may not be 
	      GNOME-compliant, but requires GTK+ widgets.  This will take care of 
	      those dependencies.  Note, this option should <b>not</b> be defined 
	      if <tt>USE_GNOME</tt> is defined.</p></li>

            <li><p><tt>USE_ESOUND (WANT_ESOUND)</tt> : The application requires 
	      (can use) esound.  Normally, esound support is added by specifying 
	      <tt>USE_GNOME</tt>.</p></li>

            <li><p><tt>USE_IMLIB (WANT_IMLIB)</tt> : The application requires 
	      (can use) the Imlib image library.  This is not needed if 
	      <tt>USE_GNOME</tt> is defined.</p></li>

            <li><p><tt>USE_GNOMELIBS (WANT_GNOMELIBS)</tt> : The application 
	      requires (can use) GNOME libraries.  This does not import as many 
	      dependencies as <tt>USE_GNOME</tt> and should be used for 
	      applications that use GNOME, but do not need the GNOME Control 
	      Center, the GNOME capplet library, or anything from the GNOME 
	      Core.</p></li>

            <li><p><tt>USE_GNOMECTRL (WANT_GNOMECTRL)</tt> : The application 
	      requires (can use) all the GNOME libraries and the GNOME Control 
	      Center, but does not use anything from GNOME Core.  This option is 
	      usually used for backend APIs.</p></li>
          </ul>

		  <p>If your port can optionally use GNOME, you must set 
		  <tt>WANT_GNOME= yes</tt> in your Makefile, then check to see if
		  <tt>HAVE_GNOME</tt> is set.  Since this is a conditional
		  evaluation, you need to stick it between <tt>bsd.port.pre.mk</tt>
		  and <tt>bsd.port.post.mk</tt>.  For example:</p>

		  <pre>
WANT_GNOME=	yes

.include &lt;bsd.port.pre.mk&gt;

.if defined(HAVE_GNOME)
USE_GNOME=	yes
CONFIGURE_ARGS+=	--with-gnome
.else
CONFIGURE_ARGS+=	--without-gnome
.endif

.include &lt;bsd.port.post.mk&gt;
          </pre>

		  <p>What happens here is <tt>WANT_GNOME</tt> tells the ports system
		  to check for the existence of <tt>gnome-config</tt>.  If it 
		  exists, <tt>HAVE_GNOME</tt> is set.  If not, <tt>HAVE_GNOME</tt>
		  remains unset.  By setting <tt>USE_GNOME</tt> after checking for
		  <tt>HAVE_GNOME</tt> the port will register all the GNOME
		  dependencies properly.</p>

          <p>When building GNOME ports, remember that many applications 
		  require shared directories in <tt>${PREFIX}/share/gnome</tt>.  Ports
		  should be constructed in a way such that files placed in these 
		  directories are removed before the package which created the
		  directories (i.e. the package that has an appropriate 
		  <tt>@dirrm</tt> in its pkg-plist).  For GNOME, the principle
		  parent port is <tt>gnomecore</tt>.  If your port incudes
		  <tt>USE_GNOME= yes</tt> you should be fine.  If you're 
		  uncertain if you need to require any other packages, you can use
		  the script <tt>${PORTSDIR}/Tools/scripts/gnomedepends.py</tt> 
		  to examine your port's pkg-plist:</p>

		  <pre>
# cd /usr/ports/x11/mygnomeport
# /usr/ports/Tools/scripts/gnomedepends.py
According to the contents of pkg-plist the port depends on the following GNOME
port(s):

/usr/ports/mail/gmail, for directories:
	share/gnome/help
	share/gnome/apps
	share/gnome

/usr/ports/sysutils/gnomecontrolcenter, for directories:
	share/gnome/apps/Settings
	share/gnome/apps

/usr/ports/textproc/scrollkeeper, for directories:
	share/gnome/omf
	share/gnome

/usr/ports/x11/gnomecore, for directories:
	share/gnome/apps/System

/usr/ports/x11/gnomelibs, for directories:
	share/gnome/pixmaps
	share/gnome/help
          </pre>

		  <p>To see a list of what packages your port will actually require,
		  use the command <tt>make package-depends</tt>.</p>

<!-- Begine GNOME I18N -->
          <h2>GNOME Internationalization</h2>
          <p>GNOME relies on the <tt>gettext</tt> port to do
	    internationalization (I18N).  FreeBSD currently supports two versions
	    of <tt>gettext</tt>: 0.10.35 and 0.10.40.  Most ports can use 
	    0.10.35.  However, if, when compiling your port, you get an error
	    building the .po translation files similar to the following you will 
	    need to use the newer version of <tt>gettext</tt>:</p>
		
	  <pre>
/usr/local/bin/msgfmt -o zh_TW.mo zh_TW.po
zh_TW.po:255: end-of-line within string
zh_TW.po:912: illegal control sequence
zh_TW.po:2806: end-of-line within string
zh_TW.po:2856: end-of-line within string
zh_TW.po:2879: illegal control sequence
zh_TW.po:2982: end-of-line within string
found 6 fatal errors
          </pre>

	  <p>To use the newer <tt>gettext</tt>, add the following to your port's 
	    Makefile:</p>

	  <pre>
BUILD_DEPENDS=  msgfmt-new:${PORTSDIR}/devel/gettext-devel
CONFIGURE_ENV+= MSGFMT=${LOCALBASE}/bin/msgfmt-new \
				XGETTEXT=${LOCALBASE}/bin/xgettext-new
	  </pre>

	  <p>When installing GNOME applications, make sure the translation
	    files are put in <tt>/usr/X11R6/share/locale</tt> and
	    not <tt>/usr/X11R6/share/gnome/locale</tt>.  To do this, add the
	    following to your port's Makefile's <tt>pre-patch:</tt> section:</p>

	  <pre>
pre-patch:
	@find ${WRKSRC} -name "Makefile.in*" | xargs ${PERL} -pi -e \
		's|\$\(datadir\)/gnome/|\$\(datadir\)/|g ; \
		 s|\$\(datadir\)/locale|\$\(prefix\)/share/locale|g'
          </pre>

	  <p>Also, make sure the translation files are installed as .mo files and 
	    not .gmo files.  To do this, you can generally use this
	    <a href="../patches/patch-po::Makefile.in.in">patch</a>.</p>

	  <p>If your port depends on iconv, make sure you substitute all
	    instances of <tt>iconv.h</tt> with <tt>giconv.h</tt>, and all
	    instances of <tt>-liconv</tt> with <tt>-lgiconv</tt>.</p>
<!-- End GNOME I18N -->

<!-- Begin GNOME libtool -->
          <h2>Libtool Issues</h2>

	  <p>Most if not all GNOME applications depend on GNU's libtool.  They
	    also use the GNU configure system.  Newer versions of libtool have
	    a problem with FreeBSD's <tt>USE_LIBTOOL</tt> macro.  Use of this
	    macro should be avoided.  Instead, set <tt>GNU_CONFIGURE= yes</tt>,
	    and use the following <a href="../patches/patch-ltmain.sh">patch</a>.
	    This patch prevents the installation of .la files, prevents
		the building and installation of static archive libraries, and
		ensures that -pthread will be passed to the linker.</p>
<!-- End GNOME libtool -->

<!-- Begin GNOME distfiles -->
          <h2>Distfiles</h2>

          <p>As GNOME 2.0 gains developer momentum, things must be done to sort
	    out the new GNOME 2.0 distfiles from the GNOME 1.0 distfiles, as well 
	    as do our part to keep the distfiles directory clean.  To do
	    this, GNOME 1.0 ports that download their distfiles from 
	    <tt>${MASTER_SITE_GNOME}</tt> must add the following to their
	    Makefile:</p>

      <pre>
DIST_SUBDIR=    gnome
      </pre>

	  <p>GNOME 2.0 ports that download their distfiles from 
	    <tt>${MASTER_SITE_GNOME}</tt> must include the following in their
	    Makefile:</p>
	
	  <pre>
DIST_SUBDIR=    gnome2
	  </pre>

	  <p>Some GNOME distfiles come in both tar gzip as well as tar bzip2 
	    format.  To save time when downloading distfiles over slow links,
	    you should use the bzip2 distfiles whenever possible.  To do this,
	    add the following to your port's Makefile:</p>

	  <pre>
USE_BZIP2=  yes
	  </pre>

<!-- End GNOME distfiles -->


          <p>If you still need help with your port, have a look at some of
		    the <a href="/ports/gnome.html">existing ports</a> for examples.
			The <a href="mailto:&email;@FreeBSD.org">freebsd-gnome mailing
			list</a> is also there for you.</p>
