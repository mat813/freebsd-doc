<!-- Simple schema for FreeBSD Project news.

     Divide time in to <year>, <month>, and <day> elements, each of which 
     has a <name>.

     each <day> element contains one or more <event> elements.

     Each <event> contains an optional <title>, and then a <p>.  <p> elements
     can contain <a> anchors.  Within the "href" attribute of the anchor
     $base will be replaced with the base URI necessary to reach the FreeBSD
     document root, and should always be used to start URLs at www.FreeBSD.org
     or one of the mirrors.

     Use the <title> element if the <p> content is lengthy.  When generating
     synopses of this information (e.g., for syndication using RDF files), 
     the contents of <title> will be preferred over <p>.

          <title>Joe Clarke now committer</title>

          <p><a href="mailto:marcus@marcuscom.com">Joe Marcus Clarke</a> has
            been granted a FreeBSD commit bit (direct access to the cvs
            repository).  His main focus as a committer will be FreeBSD
            GNOME, so that expect much faster problem resolution than ever.
            It is also expected that he would revive somewhat stalled GNOME2
            porting effort.  Welcome aboard, Joe!!!</p>

          <title>Work on porting GNOME2 platform to FreeBSD has begun</title>

          <p>The FreeBSD GNOME team started some initial work on getting
            GNOME2 bits and pieces running on FreeBSD.  The work is expected
            to take quite some time, though some initial set of ports
            making up core of the GNOME2 platform would be committed to the
            FreeBSD ports repository as soon as possible.</p>

          <title>Ade is back!</title>

          <p>Famous <a href="mailto:ade@FreeBSD.org">Ade Lovett</a>, who was
            one of the main founders of the FreeBSD GNOME porting effort, but
            due to various reasons had left the FreeBSD GNOME team in June 2001
            decided to re-join us.  This is truly amazing news, because we
            still have many things to do, so that his help and huge
            experience in the field would be really useful.</p>
