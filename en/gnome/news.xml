<!-- Simple schema for FreeBSD Project news.

     Divide time in to <year>, <month>, and <day> elements, each of which 
     has a <name>.

     each <day> element contains one or more <event> elements.

     Each <event> contains an optional <title>, and then a <p>.  <p> elements
     can contain <a> anchors.  Within the "href" attribute of the anchor
     $base will be replaced with the base URI necessary to reach the FreeBSD
     document root, and should always be used to start URLs at www.FreeBSD.org
     or one of the mirrors.

     Use the <title> element if the <p> content is lengthy.  When generating
     synopses of this information (e.g., for syndication using RDF files), 
     the contents of <title> will be preferred over <p>.

          <p>The FreeBSD <a href="mailto:gnome@FreeBSD.org">GNOME Team</a>
            has finished porting of GNOME2 beta 5 release to FreeBSD.

            The FreeBSD Ports Collection now contains all bits and
            pieces of the GNOME2 platform, both desktop and development
            ones.</p>

          <p>The team now works on improving quility of the port, by
            tracking down FreeBSD-specific problems and fixing them.
            Another goal is to provide set of pre-built GNOME2 binary
            packages on the official FreeBSD 4.6 release media along with
            GNOME 1.4 bits and pieces.</p>
