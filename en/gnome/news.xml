<!-- Simple schema for FreeBSD Project news.

     Divide time in to <year>, <month>, and <day> elements, each of which 
     has a <name>.

     each <day> element contains one or more <event> elements.

     Each <event> contains an optional <title>, and then a <p>.  <p> elements
     can contain <a> anchors.  Within the "href" attribute of the anchor
     $base will be replaced with the base URI necessary to reach the FreeBSD
     document root, and should always be used to start URLs at www.FreeBSD.org
     or one of the mirrors.

     Use the <title> element if the <p> content is lengthy.  When generating
     synopses of this information (e.g., for syndication using RDF files), 
     the contents of <title> will be preferred over <p>.

          <title>Ade is back!</title>

          <p>Famous <a href="mailto:ade@FreeBSD.org">Ade Lovett</a>, who was
            one of the main founders of the FreeBSD GNOME porting effort, but
            due to various reasons had left the FreeBSD GNOME team in June 2001
            decided to re-join us.  This is truly amazing news, because we
            still have many things to do, so that his help and huge
            experience in the field would be really useful.</p>
