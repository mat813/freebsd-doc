Outstanding tasks
-----------------

- Convert FAQ into DocBook. (marcus)

- Add the FreeBSD GNOME Porject RDF newsfeed to Evo (marcus).

- Create a cool FreeBSD/GNOME logo to put onto the main page. I have a
  good name - Gnomon and overall vision: one of the Chucks, but "gnomised" -
  beard, shoes and so on, but complete absence of art skills prevent me
  from doing it on my own. (marcus, my girlfriend offered to help on this
  if we need it)

- Revamp the screenshots page. (anders)

- ???. (???)
