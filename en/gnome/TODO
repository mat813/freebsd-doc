Outstanding tasks
-----------------

Since we are getting very close to official launch (some 90% I think is done),
it would probably make sense to lay down list of things that need to be done.
Feel free to pick up some of them, add your own and so on.


Before the official launch:

- ???. (???)


After the official launch:

- Announce via all available channels: Gnotices, ./, DDN, FreeBSD Newsflash
  etc. :) (sobomax, marcus)

- Convert FAQ into DocBook. (marcus)

- Add .rdf newsfeed (should be easy) and patch Evo/Moz/Nau to use this feed,
  maybe even by default. (???)

- Create a cool FreeBSD/GNOME logo to put onto the main page. I have a
  good name - Gnomon and overall vision: one of the Chucks, but "gnomised" -
  beard, shoes and so on, but complete absence of art skills prevent me
  from doing it on my own. (marcus, my girlfriend offered to help on this
  if we need it)

- ???. (???)
