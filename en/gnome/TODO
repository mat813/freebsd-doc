Outstanding tasks
-----------------

Since we are getting very close to official launch (some 90% I think is done),
it would probably make sense to lay down list of things that need to be done.
Feel free to pick up some of them, add your own and so on.


Before the official launch:

- Link GNOME Newsflash to the main News page. (sobomax)

- Link GNOME on FreeBSD to the main FreeBSD page with the list of projects.
  (sobomax)

- Check that all links are in a good shape. (anders)

- Few more cool shots. (anders)

- Once all other tasks are complete pass all pages through ispell. (marcus)

- ???. (???)


After the official launch:

- Announce via all available channels: Gnotices, ./, DDN, FreeBSD Newsflash
  etc. :) (sobomax, anyone else???)

- Convert FAQ into DocBook. (marcus)

- Add .rdf newsfeed (should be easy) and patch Evo/Moz/Nau to use this feed,
  maybe even by default. (???)

- Create a cool FreeBSD/GNOME logo to put onto the main page. I have a
  good name - Gnomon and overall vision: one of the Chucks, but "gnomised" -
  beard, shoes and so on, but complete absence of art skills prevent me
  from doing it on my own. (anders, I can give it a try atleast; marcus,
  my girlfriend offered to help on this if we need it)

- ???. (???)
