    <h2>What Are Snapshots?</h2>

    <p>As part of an ongoing effort to improve the overall release process
      <em>before</em> a release actually slips out the door with problems,
      we are now periodically producing interim test releases called
      <em>snapshots</em>.
      These snapshots will be very similar to full releases,
      except that they will be somewhat more minimal.</p>

    <h2>Getting Snapshots</h2>

    <p>The snapshots currently available are the following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="&url.snapshots;/Feb_2005/">5-STABLE February, 2005</a>

	<ul>
	  <li><a href="&url.snapshots;/Feb_2005/RELNOTES.TXT">abridged release notes</a></li>
	</ul>
      </li>
<!-- template for adding a new entry:

      <li><a href="&url.snapshots;/Feb_2005/">5-STABLE February, 2005</a>

	<ul>
	  <li><a href="&url.snapshots;/Feb_2005/RELNOTES.TXT">abridged release notes</a></li>
	</ul>
      </li>
-->
    </ul>

    <p>Currently the snapshots of
      <a href="&base;/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/current-stable.html#CURRENT">6-CURRENT</a>
      and <a href="&base;/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/current-stable.html#STABLE">5-STABLE</a>
      are released monthly in URLs in the format
      <tt>ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/snapshots/&lt;month&gt;_&lt;year&gt;/&lt;arch&gt;/</tt>
      where <tt>&lt;year&gt;</tt> is the year,
      <tt>&lt;month&gt;</tt> is the month the snapshot was released,
      and <tt>&lt;arch&gt;</tt> is the architecture which the snapshot for.
      Each snapshot directory contains a <tt>RELNOTES.TXT</tt>
      file which outlines the changes for the particular snapshot.</p>

    <h2>Things You Might Want to Know</h2>

    <p>In particular, before getting and installing a snapshot release,
      be aware of following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The snapshots are primarily for
	testing purpose and not fully tested compared to the releases.
	They may include experimental or degraded features that
	can corrupt your existing system.</li>

      <li>The major release number will not be changed in the
	main distribution for each snapshot.
	It will <em>only</em> be changed on the boot floppies
	so that you know when the snapshot was made.
	These are <em>not</em> releases, these are <em>snapshots</em>,
	and it is important that this distinction be preserved.
	Although people can and will, of course, refer to snapshots
	by date in mail or netnews, do not confuse them.</li>

      <li>Finally, we will not necessarily update the documentation.
	For example, <tt>README</tt> may still refer
	to a previous release.  This is because that is much less important
	than getting the real bug fixes and new features out for testing.
	Please do not send a bug report about the documentation.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Your feedback on these snapshots is, of course, greatly welcome.
      They are not just for our benefit - those who are coming to rely
      on FreeBSD for mission critical applications should welcome
      a chance to get at more updated bits in a structured fashion.
      You can also use these snapshots as tangible evidence that your
      feedback is getting incorporated and that you (hopefully) will not have
      any unpleasant surprises in the next release.
      On the other hand, if you do send us hate mail next release
      and it turns out that you never even tried the snapshots,
      well, it cuts both ways!</p>
