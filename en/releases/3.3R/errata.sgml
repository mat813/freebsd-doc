---- Security Advisories:

Current active security advisories for 3.3:     None

---- System Update Information:

<strong>The fvwm desktop choice in the X Desktops menu doesn't work.</strong>
                                                                              
Fix: Install fvwm from /usr/ports/x11-wm/fvwm2 instead of using the
     desktop menu item and put "fvwm" in your $HOME/.xinitrc and
     $HOME/.xsession files for use by startx/xdm.  You can also build
     and reinstall /usr/src/release/sysinstall from 3.3-STABLE sources
     to fix the X Desktop menu item in question.
