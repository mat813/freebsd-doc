<h1>Open Issues</h1>

<p>This is a list of open issues that need to be resolved for FreeBSD
  5.1.  If you have any updates for this list, please e-mail
  re@FreeBSD.org.</p>

<h3>Must Resolve Issues for 5.1-RELEASE</h3>

<table border=1 width="100%">
  <tr><th>Issue</th><th>Status</th><th>Responsible</th><th>Description</th>
      </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>Race conditions in truss</td>
  <td>Errata candidate</td>
  <td>&a.robert;</td>
  <td>Truss appears to contain a race condition during the start-up of
    debugging, which can result in truss failing to attach to the process
    before it exits.  The symptom is that truss reports that it cannot
    open the procfs node supporting the process being debugged.  A bug
    also appears to exist where in truss will hang if execve() returns
    ENOENT.  A further race appears to exist in which truss will return
    "PIOCWAIT: Input/output error" occasionally on startup.  The fix
    for this sufficiently changes process execution handling that we
    will defer the fix to post-5.0 and consider this errata.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>iir driver fails to probe disks</td>
  <td>--</td>
  <td>--</td>
  <td>During the install, the iir controller appears to correctly
    probe, but finds no disk devices.  The card in question is an
    Intel srcu32 RAID controller with 32Mb RAM, Firmware revision
    2.33.01.  Direct access to real iir hardware for SCSI
    developers would be very helpful in resolving this problem.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>if_wi problems on Lucent hardware</td>
  <td>In Progress</td>
  <td>&a.imp;, &a.sam;</td>
  <td>The recently upgraded if_wi driver is more tuned to Prism hardware
    than to Lucent hardware, resulting in system lockups and poor performance
    when using Lucent hardware.</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
  <td>lazy context switching for i386</td>
  <td>In Progress</td>
  <td>&a.peter;</td>
  <td>Lazy Context Switching allows for faster context switches and should
    mitigate the some of the latency introduced with interrupt threads and
    GEOM kernel threads.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>Fresh ACPI-CA import</td>
  <td>--</td>
  <td>--</td>
  <td>The last ACPI-CA import happened in Oct 2002.  Vendor releases since then
    address various bugs that have also plagued FreeBSD 5.0 users.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>PAE support for i386</td>
  <td>In Progress</td>
  <td>&a.jake;</td>
  <td>PAE support allows the use of up to 64GB of RAM on Pentium Pro and above
    systems.  Virtual addresses are still contrained to 32-bits.</td>

<h3>Desired Features for 5.1-RELEASE</h3>

<table border=1 width="100%">
  <tr><th>Issue</th><th>Status</th><th>Responsible</th><th>Description</th>
      </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>a.out toolchain port</td>
  <td>--</td>
  <td>--</td>
  <td>A.out support in the base system was reduced; the removed build
    chain components should be made into a port.</td>
  </tr>

<h3>Documentation items that must be resolved for 5.1</h3>

<table border=1 width="100%">
  <tr><th>Issue</th><th>Status</th><th>Responsible</th><th>Description</th>
      </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>No docs for FAST IPSEC</td>
  <td>--</td>
  <td>--</td>
  <td>The new "fast ipsec" implementation has insufficient documentation
    (man pages, release notes), and this would be highly desirable to
    have before 5.0-RELEASE.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>Documentation rottage: S/Key</td>
  <td>--</td>
  <td>--</td>
  <td>We now use OPIE instead of S/Key.  The handbook doesn't know
    that yet.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>Documentation wanted: gdbe</td>
  <td>--</td>
  <td>&a.chris;</td>
  <td>5.0 includes GDBE, supporting encryption of swap and storage.
    It would be nice if that was documented in the handbook.</td>
  </tr>

<h3>Areas requiring immediate testing due to 5.0 changes</h3>

<table border=1 width="100%">
  <tr><th>Issue</th><th>Status</th><th>Responsible</th><th>Description</th>
      </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>No console (term) if smbus is enable in the kernel</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>There are reports that kernels build with smbus, viapm, and smb
      devices may not properly probe and support the system console
      following boot.</td>
