<h1>Open Issues</h1>

<p>This is a list of open issues that need to be resolved for FreeBSD
  5.1.  If you have any updates for this list, please e-mail
  re@FreeBSD.org.</p>

<h3>Must Resolve Issues for 5.1-RELEASE</h3>

<table border=1 width="100%">
  <tr><th>Issue</th><th>Status</th><th>Responsible</th><th>Description</th>
      </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>ipfw/ipfw2 alignment issues on alpha/sparc64</td>
  <td>In progress</td>
  <td>&a.luigi;</td>
  <td>There are reports of alignment problems with ipfw and/or ipfw2
    on 64-bit platforms (specifically alpha and sparc64).</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>ia64 stability</td>
  <td>--</td>
  <td>--</td>
  <td>&a.kris; reports high instability of 5.0-CURRENT on ia64
    machines, such as the pluto* machines.  These problems need to be
    fixed in order to get a successful package build.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>data corruption reports</td>
    <td>In progress</td>
    <td>&a.peter;, &a.bmilekic;</td>
    <td>There have been reports of memory/data corruption on some systems;
      one working hypothesis is that this corresponds to an undocumented
      bug in a particular line of Intel and AMD processors, but it's
      unclear whether current work-arounds are correcting or masking the
      problem.  Patches are being circulated to test this hypothesis,
      but developers are encouraged to be on the lookout for possible
      data corruption bugs.</td>

<h3>Desired Features for 5.1-RELEASE</h3>

<table border=1 width="100%">
  <tr><th>Issue</th><th>Status</th><th>Responsible</th><th>Description</th>
      </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>Race conditions in truss</td>
  <td>Errata candidate</td>
  <td>&a.robert;</td>
  <td>Truss appears to contain a race condition during the start-up of
    debugging, which can result in truss failing to attach to the process
    before it exits.  The symptom is that truss reports that it cannot
    open the procfs node supporting the process being debugged.  A bug
    also appears to exist where in truss will hang if execve() returns
    ENOENT.  A further race appears to exist in which truss will return
    "PIOCWAIT: Input/output error" occasionally on startup.  The fix
    for this sufficiently changes process execution handling that we
    will defer the fix to post-5.0 and consider this errata.</td>
  </tr>

<h3>Documentation items that must be resolved for 5.1</h3>

<table border=1 width="100%">
  <tr><th>Issue</th><th>Status</th><th>Responsible</th><th>Description</th>
      </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>busdma man page</td>
    <td>In progress</td>
    <td>&a.hmp;</td>
    <td>As BUSDMA is now the required driver API for DMA access in
      hardware device drivers as of 5.1-RELEASE, we need to make sure
      it's properly documented.  A man page is in progress and needs
      to be appropriately reviewed and committed prior to the release.</td>
  </tr>

<h3>Areas requiring immediate testing</h3>

<table border=1 width="100%">
  <tr><th>Issue</th><th>Status</th><th>Responsible</th><th>Description</th>
      </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>Fresh ACPI-CA import</td>
  <td>--</td>
  <td>--</td>
  <td>The 20030228 vendor sources have been imported.  Further testing is
    appreciated.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>PAE support for i386</td>
  <td>--</td>
  <td>--</td>
  <td>PAE support allows the use of up to 64GB of RAM on Pentium Pro and above
    systems.  Virtual addresses are still constrained to 32-bits.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>if_wi problems on Lucent hardware</td>
  <td>--</td>
  <td>--</td>
  <td>The recently upgraded if_wi driver is more tuned to Prism hardware
    than to Lucent hardware, resulting in system lockups and poor performance
    when using Lucent hardware.  These problems are believed to be fixed
    but more testing is welcome.</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
  <td>UFS2 as installation, newfs default</td>
  <td>--</td>
  <td>&a.rwatson;</td>
  <td>For 5.1-RELEASE, the default file system type for newly created
    file systems is UFS2 rather than UFS1.  newfs(8) and sysinstall(8)
    have been updated to use this new default.  Testing to make sure all
    goes well after the change (committed on April 20, 2003) is
    vital.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>NSSwitch support</td>
  <td>--</td>
  <td>&a.nectar;</td>
  <td>Support for pluggable directory services using NSS, including
    adaptations of current directory services (local databases, NIS),
    and support for new services (LDAP, Active Directory, etc).
    This change has been committed, and requires broader testing.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>Spurious alpha panics</td>
  <td>--</td>
  <td>--</td>
  <td>&a.kris; reports that he has seen several unique panics on the
    alpha machines, but since gdb -k doesn't work on alpha I haven't
    been able to get more than a DDB traceback.  No-one has looked
    into them.</td>
