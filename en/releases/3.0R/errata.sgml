---- System Update Information:

<strong>
o The GPL_MATH_EMULATE kernel option causes a fatal trap during system
  startup.</strong>

Fix: Replace the GPL_MATH_EMULATE option with the default math
     emulation option MATH_EMULATE.  This will only affect users who
     have modified their kernel configuration file.  The problem is
     corrected in revision 1.16 of the file 
     /usr/src/sys/gnu/i386/fpemul/fpu_entry.c.
