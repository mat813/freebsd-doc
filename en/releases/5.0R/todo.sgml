<h1>Open Issues</h1>

<p>This is a list of open issues that need to be resolved for FreeBSD
  5.0.  If you think something should be listed here, please email
  re@FreeBSD.org.  This issue was discussed in detail at the <a
  href="&base;/events/2002/usenix-devsummit.html">Developer Summit</a>
  at Usenix.</p>

<h3>Must Resolve Issues for 5.0-RELEASE</h3>

  <tr><th>Issue</th><th>Status</th><th>Responsible</th><th>Description</th>
      </tr>

  <tr><td>5.0 Documentation</td><td>--</td><td>freebsd-doc</td>

  <td>As a minimum, we need to cover the areas where 5.x and 4.x
    differ in the FAQ and Handbook.  This entails marking some areas
    with "This procedure is specific to 4.X.  For more information for
    5.x, please see foo(n)" or similar.  This needs to happen quickly,
    to give adequate time for the translation teams to catch up.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>Disable performance penalizing debug options</td>
  <td>Pending RC1
  <td>re@</td>
  <td>A number of performance-penalizing debug options are turned on
    by default in 5.0-CURRENT.  These include user malloc debugging
    flags, WITNESS, INVARIANTS, and others.  These must be turned off
    as we approach the release.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr><td>devd</td><td>Prototype committed.</td>
    <td>imp@FreeBSD.org</td><td>A devd prototype has been committed;
    will mature as we approach the 5.0 release, including adopting
    a mature configuration format.</td></tr>

  <tr>
  <td>TrustedBSD MAC Framework userland applications</td>
    <td>Perforce trustedbsd_mac: preparing for merge to main tree</td>
    <td>rwatson@FreeBSD.org</td>
    <td>Simple labeling applications including {get,set}[fp]mac(8),
      as well as labeling during the login process.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>TrustedBSD MAC Framework documentation</td>
    <td>FreeBSD documentation CVS HEAD: in progress</td>
    <td>chris@FreeBSD.org</td><td>User and developer documentation of
      the new extensible security framework.  Includes guides for live
      deployment, development of policy modules, and implementation
      information.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>Port of LOMAC to TrustedBSD MAC Framework</td>
    <td>Perforce trustedbsd_mac: in progress</td>
    <td>green@FreeBSD.org</td>
    <td>Re-implementation of LOMAC to plug in via the MAC framework,
      making it easier to deploy and support, as well as removing
      code duplication in the LOMAC tree to improve maintenance cost.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>gdb for sparc64</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>tmm@FreeBSD.org</td>
    <td>gdb 5.3 now works with sparc64; gdb import required.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>Sysinstall for sparc64</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>phk@FreeBSD.org</td>
    <td>Sysinstall currently doesn't understand disk labeling sufficiently
      to correctly install on sparc64.  Various approaches might be
      taken, including adopting libwhisk as an extendable labeling
      mechanism, but the work hasn't yet been done.  For sparc64 to be
      a Tier 1 supported platform, it needs sysinstall to work out
      of the box.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>UFS2 bootable on i386</td>
    <td>In progress.  We might want to miss on this one.</td>
    <td>phk@FreeBSD.org</td>
    <td>UFS2 can be successfully booted on sparc64, but on i386
      boot2 cannot fit in the space reserved in front of a UFS1 filesystem.
      disklabel, libdisk, sysinstall and newfs needs to learn about this
      wrinkle, and we need some makefile magic to build both UFS1 and
      UFS1/2 boot2 boot files.
      The potential for foot-shooting is very large, and phk@ currently
      leans towards defaulting to UFS1 for root and boot, and UFS2 for
      all other filesystems.

  <td>ACPI support for multiple host-pci bridge adapters</td>
    <td>patches being circulated</td>
    <td>jhb@FreeBSD.org</td>
    <td>There appear to be problems with BIOS's incorrectly identifying
      host-pci bridge adpaters.  These must be resolved before 5.0.</td>

    <td>Firewire kernel support has been committed.  Userland support is
      pending.  Large quantities of debugging output are reported;

    <td>luigi@FreeBSD.org</td><td>In order for IPFW2 to be the default
      firewall package in FreeBSD 5.0-RELEASE, it needs to work properly
      on non-i386 platforms.  Currently it crashes on Alpha and sparc64
      due to alignment problems.</td>

<h3>Desired Features for 5.0-RELEASE</h3>

<table border=1 width="100%">

    <td>The new ACPI code is a very important component of FreeBSD
    5.0-RELEASE, but the documentation is insufficient.  The manual
    page does not describe how to perform the basic ACPI tasks.  The
    Usenix paper, man pages, and mailing list archives should be used
    to write a substantial new section to the FreeBSD Handbook.  New
    users read the Handbook.  See <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=43528">PR 43528</a>.</td>
