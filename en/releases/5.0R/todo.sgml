<h1>Open Issues</h1>

<p>This is a list of open issues that need to be resolved for FreeBSD
  5.0.  If you have any updates for this list, please e-mail
  re@FreeBSD.org.</p>


<h3>Must Resolve Issues for 5.0-RC1</h3>
<table border=1 width="100%">
  <tr><th>Issue</th><th>Status</th><th>Responsible</th><th>Description</th>
      </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>Audit of devfs device permissions</td>
  <td>In progress</td>
  <td>kris@</td>
  <td>With the move to devfs, the permissions specified in kernel device
    creation lines using make_dev() are now used as the default permissions
    for /dev entries.  Some of these entries are more lax than is desired,
    or than the MAKEDEV defaults in 4.x.  These need to be carefully
    reviewed and fixed.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>Many reported problems with disklabel -e</td>
  <td>--</td>
  <td>phk@, jhb@</td>
  <td>Changes in the disk label format have resulted in substantial
    numbers of bug reports; these must be resolved by RC1.  The problem
    involving a cache coherency issue relating to partition resizes
    has now been resolved.  Problems relating to disklabel -r and
    the change appear to continue.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>Need to disable rare ISA drivers via hints</td>
  <td>--</td>
  <td>jhb@</td>
  <td>ISA driver probes for rare drivers can be disruptive, and should
    be disabled.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>syscons hangs on SMP systems</td>
  <td>--</td>
  <td>scottl@</td>
  <td>There are reports of output hangs for syscons on SMP boxes,
    which may involve a failure of the timeout() update of the
    system display.  The system appears to be otherwise functional.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>sysinstall support for UFS2</td>
    <td>Patches being circulated.</td>
    <td>rwatson@</td>
    <td>Teach sysinstall how to properly create UFS2 partitions, and
      under what circumstances that is appropriate.</td>

  <tr>
  <td>mly driver hangs during install</td>
  <td>--</td>
  <td>scottl@, jeff@</td>
  <td>Hangs have been reported during the 5.0 snapshot install when
    installing to mly supported RAID arrays.  The same array appears
    to work fine with 4.7-RELEASE.  The card in question is a Mylex
    AcceleRAID 170, 32 Mb RAM, Firmware revision 7.01-00.  This is
    believed to be the same problem as described in PR 45383.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>iir driver fails to probe disks</td>
  <td>--</td>
  <td>--</td>
  <td>During the install, the iir controller appears to correctly
    probe, but finds no disk devices.  The card in question is an
    Intel srcu32 RAID controller with 32Mb RAM, Firmware revision
    2.33.01</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>Disable performance penalizing debug options</td>
  <td>Pending RC1</td>
  <td>re@</td>
  <td>A number of performance-penalizing debug options are turned on
    by default in 5.0-CURRENT.  These include user malloc debugging
    flags, WITNESS, INVARIANTS, DEBUG=-g, and others.  These must be
    turned off as we approach the release.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>TrustedBSD MAC Framework userland applications</td>
    <td>Mostly merged, some minor updates pending</td>
    <td>rwatson@</td>
    <td>Most MAC support for user applications and daemons has been
      merged.  Minor updates to support correct labeling in inetd,
      optional labeling of ttys, and a few other bits and pieces are
      pending.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>Port of LOMAC to TrustedBSD MAC Framework</td>
    <td>Merge in progress</td>
    <td>green@,rwatson@</td>
    <td>New mac_lomac implementation almost completely merged:
      currently missing are the default policy file (commit request
      under review by re@) and documentation.</td>

  <tr><td>devd</td><td>Prototype committed.</td>
    <td>imp@</td><td>A devd prototype has been committed;
    will mature as we approach the 5.0 release, including adopting
    a mature configuration format.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Convert base system utilities that rely on Perl</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>markm</td>
    <td>With perl removed from the base system in 5.0, any existing
      dependencies on perl must also be converted to a native shell
      scripting language, C, or be made into packages or ports.
      Remaining base system tools include mmroff, afmtodit.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>KerberosV, OpenSSH, and PAM</td>
    <td>In progress</td>
    <td>markm@, des@, nectar@</td>
    <td>KerberosV appears not to currently work with OpenSSH using PAM.
      Bugs relating to pam_kerberosV have in large part been fixed.</td>

<h3>Must Resolve Issues for 5.0-RELEASE</h3>

<table border=1 width="100%">
  <tr><th>Issue</th><th>Status</th><th>Responsible</th><th>Description</th>
      </tr>

  <tr><td>5.0 Documentation</td><td>--</td><td>freebsd-doc</td>

  <td>As a minimum, we need to cover the areas where 5.x and 4.x
    differ in the FAQ and Handbook.  This entails marking some areas
    with "This procedure is specific to 4.X.  For more information for
    5.x, please see foo(n)" or similar.  This needs to happen quickly,
    to give adequate time for the translation teams to catch up.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>Disable verbose debug options</td>
  <td>Pending RC2</td>
  <td>re@</td>
  <td>By default, ACPI generates verbose bus dumps during initial
    boot even if verbose it turned off.  Libdisk also includes
    the DEBUG define by default, resulting in additional output.
    This output needs to be turned down following RC2.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>TrustedBSD MAC Framework documentation</td>
    <td>FreeBSD documentation CVS HEAD: in progress</td>
    <td>chris@</td><td>User and developer documentation of
      the new extensible security framework.  Includes guides for live
      deployment, development of policy modules, and implementation
      information.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>UFS2 bootable on i386</td>
    <td>In progress.  We might want to miss on this one.</td>
    <td>phk@</td>
    <td>UFS2 can be successfully booted on sparc64, but on i386
      boot2 cannot fit in the space reserved in front of a UFS1 filesystem.
      disklabel, libdisk, sysinstall and newfs needs to learn about this
      wrinkle, and we need some makefile magic to build both UFS1 and
      UFS1/2 boot2 boot files.
      The potential for foot-shooting is very large, and phk@ currently
      leans towards defaulting to UFS1 for root and boot, and UFS2 for
      all other filesystems.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>FireWire Support</td>
    <td>In progress</td>
    <td>simokawa@</td>
    <td>Firewire kernel support has been committed.  Userland support is
      pending.  Large quantities of debugging output are reported;
      may require an "experimental feature tag" for the release notes?</td>

  <td>Report of a panic in the TCP syncache thread under load, due to
    another thread sleeping while holding an inpcb mutex, when not
    running with WITNESS (WITNESS would have caught the sleep earlier).

<h3>Desired Features for 5.0-RELEASE</h3>

  <tr>
    <td width="30%">User documentation for ACPI.</td>
    <td width="10%">--</td>
    <td width="10%">freebsd-doc@</td>

    <td>The new ACPI code is a very important component of FreeBSD
    5.0-RELEASE, but the documentation is insufficient.  The manual
    page does not describe how to perform the basic ACPI tasks.  The
    Usenix paper, man pages, and mailing list archives should be used
    to write a substantial new section to the FreeBSD Handbook.  New
    users read the Handbook.  See <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=43528">PR 43528</a>.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>a.out toolchain port</td>
  <td>--</td>
  <td>--</td>
  <td>A.out support in the base system was reduced; the removed build
    chain components should be made into a port.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>Rename of local -> unix in rpc socket names</td>
  <td>--</td>
  <td>mbr@</td>
  <td>mbr has requested that we change from using "local" to "unix"
    for tirpc unix domain socket transport naming, to sync to NetBSD.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>NETNCP and nwfs broken</td>
  <td>--</td>
  <td>--</td>
  <td>NETNCP and nwfs appear to be as-yet unadapted for KSE, and hence
    not working.  The build needs fixing (probably not all that hard)
    and then it needs to be tested (harder: few people appear to have
    Netware servers).</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>No docs for FAST IPSEC</td>
  <td>--</td>
  <td>--</td>
  <td>The new "fast ipsec" implementation has insufficient documentation
    (man pages, release notes), and this would be highly desirable to
    have before 5.0-RELEASE.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>gdb for sparc64</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>tmm@</td>
    <td>gdb 5.3 now works with sparc64; gdb import desired.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>live file system boot0cfg</td>
  <td>--</td>
  <td>--</td>
  <td>boot0cfg -s on a live file system now no longer functions.  It
    would be highly desirable for this, and related functionality, to
    work.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>SMP documentation update</td>
  <td>--</td>
  <td>--</td>
  <td>smp(4) and other bits of system documentation relating to SMP
    are dated since to introduction of SMPng, MP support on sparc64,
    alpha, and ia64.  These documents should be updated.  In addition,
    the SMPng draft architecture should be updated and committed.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>Race conditions in truss</td>
  <td>Debugging and fixing in progress</td>
  <td>robert@</td>
  <td>Truss appears to contain a race condition during the start-up of
    debugging, which can result in truss failing to attach to the process
    before it exits.  The symptom is that truss reports that it cannot
    open the procfs node supporting the process being debugged.  A bug
    also appears to exist where in truss will hang if execve() returns
    ENOENT.  A further race appears to exist in which truss will return
    "PIOCWAIT: Input/output error" occasionally on startup.</td>

<h3>Areas requiring immediate testing due to 5.0 changes</h3>

<table border=1 width="100%">
  <tr><th>Issue</th><th>Status</th><th>Responsible</th><th>Description</th>
      </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>if_ie, if_le, if_wl network device drivers</td>
  <td>--</td>
  <td>sam@</td>
  <td>Changes made to the ethernet driver interfaces required sweeping
    API changes across all ethernet device drivers.  While these
    changes are largely mechanical, they were not tested for three less
    frequently used interface drivers: if_ie, if_le, and if_wl.  They
    each require testing (and probably fixing) prior to 5.0-RELEASE.
    If you have access to devices that use these drivers, please perform
    local testing and provide feedback to Sam Leffler.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>vlan testing</td>
  <td>--</td>
  <td>sam@</td>
  <td>Changes to the network device driver interfaces and introduction
    of m_tags has changed the way in which vlans are implemented in
    5.0.  These changes require additional testing.  If you make use
    if the vlan behavior in local configurations, please test them
    with recent 5.0 snapshots and provide feedback to Sam Leffler.</td>
