<h1>Open Issues</h1>

<p>This is a list of open issues that need to be resolved for FreeBSD
  5.0.  If you think something should be listed here, please email
  re@FreeBSD.org.  This issue was discussed in detail at the <a
  href="&base;/events/2002/usenix-devsummit.html">Developer Summit</a>
  at Usenix.</p>

<h3>Must Resolve Issues for 5.0-RELEASE</h3>

  <tr><th>Issue</th><th>Status</th><th>Responsible</th><th>Description</th>
      </tr>

  <tr><td>5.0 Documentation</td><td>--</td><td>freebsd-doc</td>

  <td>As a minimum, we need to cover the areas where 5.x and 4.x
    differ in the FAQ and Handbook.  This entails marking some areas
    with "This procedure is specific to 4.X.  For more information for
    5.x, please see foo(n)" or similar.  This needs to happen quickly,
    to give adequate time fo rthe translation teams to catch up.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr><td>devd</td><td>Unknown</td><td>imp@FreeBSD.org</td><td>A devd
    prototype to manage the insertion and removal of devices (usb,
    firewire, pccard, etc..) from the system.</td></tr>

  <tr>
  <td>KDE / GNOME</td><td>Unknown after GCC upgrade</td><td>ports@FreeBSD.org</td>
  <td>Working KDE and GNOME packages are a requirement for 5.0
  RELEASE.  Before the recent GCC upgrade, there were problems
  building parts of KDE.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>TrustedBSD MAC Framework system call interface</td>
    <td>Perforce rwatson_macnewapi: in progress</td>
    <td>rwatson@FreeBSD.org</td>
    <td>Revised system call interface supporting extensible label access
      from userland.  This replaces the current temporary API which
      supports only a subset of the available policies and is not
      extensible at run-time.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>TrustedBSD MAC Framework userland applications</td>
    <td>Perforce trustedbsd_mac: in progress</td>
    <td>rwatson@FreeBSD.org</td>
    <td>Simple labeling applications including {get,set}[fp]mac(8),
      as well as labeling during the login process.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>TrustedBSD MAC Framework documentation</td>
    <td>FreeBSD documentation CVS HEAD: in progress</td>
    <td>chris@FreeBSD.org</td><td>User and developer documentation of
      the new extensible security framework.  Includes guides for live
      deployment, development of policy modules, and implementation
      information.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>Port of LOMAC to TrustedBSD MAC Framework</td>
    <td>Perforce trustedbsd_mac: in progress</td>
    <td>green@FreeBSD.org</td>
    <td>Re-implementation of LOMAC to plug in via the MAC framework,
      making it easier to deploy and support, as well as removing
      code duplication in the LOMAC tree to improve maintenance cost.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>Switch to GEOM as default storage management framework</td>
    <td>FreeBSD CVS HEAD: in progress</td>
    <td>phk@FreeBSD.org</td><td>Move to using GEOM in the GENERIC
      kernel as the default storage management framework, supporting
      out-of-the-box use of new partiton types, data transforms (such
      as cryptographic swap protection), etc.</td>

  <td>gdb for sparc64</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>tmm@FreeBSD.org</td>
    <td>gdb currently does not work on sparc64, but is a required feature
      for sparc64 to be a Tier 1 supported platform.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>Sysinstall for sparc64</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>phk@FreeBSD.org</td>
    <td>Sysinstall currently doesn't understand disk labeling sufficiently
      to correctly install on sparc64.  Various approaches might be
      taken, including adopting libwhisk as an extendable labeling
      mechanism, but the work hasn't yet been done.  For sparc64 to be
      a Tier 1 supported platform, it needs sysinstall to work out
      of the box.</td>

  <tr>
  <td>UFS2 bootable on i386</td>
    <td>In progress</td>
    <td>green@FreeBSD.org, phk@FreeBSD.org</td>
    <td>UFS2 can be successfully booted on sparc64, but on i386 the
      emulated 64-bit instructions grow boot2 beyond the 8k traditionally
      allocated for that boot loader.  There appear to be some combination
      of books in various bits of the boot loading mecahnism relating
      to this (possibly including in the i386 emulated 64-bit instructions)
      that must be resolved.  In addition, the installation code now needs
      to start leaving room for the larger boot blocks so that freshly
      installed systems can be UFS2-bootable.</td>

<h3>Desired Features for 5.0-RELEASE</h3>

<table border=1 width="100%">
  <tr><th>Issue</th><th>Status</th><th>Responsible</th><th>Description</th>
      </tr>

  <tr>
    <td width="30%">User Documentation for device.hints
    mechanism.</td><td width="10%">--</td><td
    width="10%">freebsd-doc@FreeBSD.org</td><td>We need more
    documentation geared at average users about how to configure
    hardware devices with the new device.hints mechanism.  This
    material should be in the Handbook.  See <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=43529">PR 43529</a>.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td width="30%">User documentation for ACPI.</td>
    <td width="10%">--</td>
    <td width="10%">freebsd-doc@FreeBSD.org</td>

    <td>The new ACPI code is a very important component of FreeBSD
    5.0-RELEASE, but the documentation is insufficient.  The manual
    page does not describe how to perform the basic ACPI tasks.  The
    Usenix paper, man pages, and mailing list archives should be used
    to write a substantial new section to the FreeBSD Handbook.  New
    users read the Handbook.  See <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=43528">PR 43528</a>.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>OpenOffice</td><td>--</td><td>ports@FreeBSD.org</td>
  <td>A working OpenOffice port is a strongly desired feature for
  5.0</td>

    <td>What is the holdup with getting this committed?</td>
