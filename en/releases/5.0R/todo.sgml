<h1>Open Issues</h1>

<p>This is a list of open issues that need to be resolved for FreeBSD
  5.0.  If you think something should be listed here, please email
  re@FreeBSD.org.  This issue was discussed in detail at the <a
  href="&base;/events/2002/usenix-devsummit.html">Developer Summit</a>
  at Usenix.</p>



<h3>Must Resolve Issues for 5.0-RC1</h3>
<table border=1 width="100%">
  <tr><th>Issue</th><th>Status</th><th>Responsible</th><th>Description</th>
      </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>Audit of devfs device permissions</td>
  <td>--</td>
  <td>kris@FreeBSD.org</td>
  <td>With the move to devfs, the permissions specified in kernel device
    creation lines using make_dev() are now used as the default permissions
    for /dev entries.  Some of these entries are more lax than is desired,
    or than the MAKEDEV defaults in 4.x.  These need to be carefully
    reviewed and fixed.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>Race conditions in truss</td>
  <td>--</td>
  <td>--</td>
  <td>Truss appears to contain a race condition during the start-up of
    debugging, which can result in truss failing to attach to the process
    before it exits.  The symptom is that truss reports that it cannot
    open the procfs node supporting the process being debugged.  A bug
    also appears to exist where in truss will hang if execve() returns
    ENOENT.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>Many reported problems with disklabel -e</td>
  <td>--</td>
  <td>phk@FreeBSD.org</td>
  <td>Changes in the disk label format have resulted in substantial
    numbers of bug reports; these must be resolved by RC1.  At least
    one known problem exists: partitions shrunk using disklabel -e
    result in newfs on the resized partition failing with a maximum
    file system size error.</td>

<h3>Must Resolve Issues for 5.0-RELEASE</h3>

<table border=1 width="100%">
  <tr><th>Issue</th><th>Status</th><th>Responsible</th><th>Description</th>
      </tr>

  <tr><td>5.0 Documentation</td><td>--</td><td>freebsd-doc</td>

  <td>As a minimum, we need to cover the areas where 5.x and 4.x
    differ in the FAQ and Handbook.  This entails marking some areas
    with "This procedure is specific to 4.X.  For more information for
    5.x, please see foo(n)" or similar.  This needs to happen quickly,
    to give adequate time for the translation teams to catch up.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>Disable performance penalizing debug options</td>
  <td>Pending RC1</td>
  <td>re@</td>
  <td>A number of performance-penalizing debug options are turned on
    by default in 5.0-CURRENT.  These include user malloc debugging
    flags, WITNESS, INVARIANTS, DEBUG=-g, and others.  These must be
    turned off as we approach the release.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>Disable verbose debug options</td>
  <td>Pending RC1</td>
  <td>By default, ACPI generates verbose bus dumps during initial
    boot even if verbose it turned off.  This output needs to be
    turned down.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr><td>devd</td><td>Prototype committed.</td>
    <td>imp@FreeBSD.org</td><td>A devd prototype has been committed;
    will mature as we approach the 5.0 release, including adopting
    a mature configuration format.</td></tr>

  <td>TrustedBSD MAC Framework userland applications</td>
    <td>Perforce trustedbsd_mac: preparing for merge to main tree</td>
    <td>rwatson@FreeBSD.org</td>
    <td>Simple labeling applications including {get,set}[fp]mac(8),
      as well as labeling during the login process.</td>

  <tr>
  <td>TrustedBSD MAC Framework documentation</td>
    <td>FreeBSD documentation CVS HEAD: in progress</td>
    <td>chris@FreeBSD.org</td><td>User and developer documentation of
      the new extensible security framework.  Includes guides for live
      deployment, development of policy modules, and implementation
      information.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>Port of LOMAC to TrustedBSD MAC Framework</td>
    <td>Perforce trustedbsd_mac: in progress</td>
    <td>green@FreeBSD.org</td>
    <td>Re-implementation of LOMAC to plug in via the MAC framework,
      making it easier to deploy and support, as well as removing
      code duplication in the LOMAC tree to improve maintenance cost.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>gdb for sparc64</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>tmm@FreeBSD.org</td>
    <td>gdb 5.3 now works with sparc64; gdb import required.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>Sysinstall for sparc64</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>phk@FreeBSD.org</td>
    <td>Sysinstall currently doesn't understand disk labeling sufficiently
      to correctly install on sparc64.  Various approaches might be
      taken, including adopting libwhisk as an extendable labeling
      mechanism, but the work hasn't yet been done.  For sparc64 to be
      a Tier 1 supported platform, it needs sysinstall to work out
      of the box.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>UFS2 bootable on i386</td>
    <td>In progress.  We might want to miss on this one.</td>
    <td>phk@FreeBSD.org</td>
    <td>UFS2 can be successfully booted on sparc64, but on i386
      boot2 cannot fit in the space reserved in front of a UFS1 filesystem.
      disklabel, libdisk, sysinstall and newfs needs to learn about this
      wrinkle, and we need some makefile magic to build both UFS1 and
      UFS1/2 boot2 boot files.
      The potential for foot-shooting is very large, and phk@ currently
      leans towards defaulting to UFS1 for root and boot, and UFS2 for
      all other filesystems.

    page does not describe how to perform the basic ACPI tasks.  The
    Usenix paper, man pages, and mailing list archives should be used
    to write a substantial new section to the FreeBSD Handbook.  New
    users read the Handbook.  See <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=43528">PR 43528</a>.</td>
