<p>This document lists errata items for FreeBSD 4.9-RELEASE, containing significant
information discovered after the release or too late in the release cycle to be otherwise
included in the release documentation. This information includes security advisories, as
well as news relating to the software or documentation that could affect its operation or
usability. An up-to-date version of this document should always be consulted before
installing this version of FreeBSD.</p>

<p>This errata document for FreeBSD 4.9-RELEASE will be maintained until the release of
FreeBSD 4.9.1-RELEASE.</p>

<p>This errata document contains ``late-breaking news'' about FreeBSD 4.9-RELEASE. Before
installing this version, it is important to consult this document to learn about any
post-release discoveries or problems that may already have been found and fixed.</p>

<p>Any version of this errata document actually distributed with the release (for
example, on a CDROM distribution) will be out of date by definition, but other copies are
kept updated on the Internet and should be consulted as the ``current errata'' for this
release. These other copies of the errata are located at <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/"
target="_top">http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/</a>, plus any sites which keep up-to-date
mirrors of this location.</p>

<p>Source and binary snapshots of FreeBSD 4-STABLE also contain up-to-date copies of this
document (as of the time of the snapshot).</p>

<h2 class="SECT1"><a id="AEN35" name="AEN35">3 Late-Breaking News</a></h2>

<p>Very late in the release cycle, a change was made to the HyperThreading (HTT) support
on <span class="TRADEMARK">Intel</span>&reg; processors. HTT support is now enabled by
default on SMP-capable kernels; as a result, the <var class="LITERAL">HTT</var> kernel
option is unnecessary and has been removed. The extra logical CPUs are always started so
that they can handle interrupts, but are prevented from executing user processes by
default. To enable the logical CPUs, change the value of the <var
class="VARNAME">machdep.hlt_logical_cpus</var> <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=sysctl&sektion=8&manpath=FreeBSD+4.8-stable">
<span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">sysctl</span>(8)</span></a>
variable from <var class="LITERAL">1</var> to <var class="LITERAL">0</var>. This value
can also be set from the loader as a tunable of the same name.</p>
