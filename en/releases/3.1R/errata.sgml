---- Security Advisories:

Current active security advisories for 3.1:     None

---- System Update Information:
<strong>
o  Some packages, like netscape, will fail to install if chosen
   at initial system installation time, in some cases claiming
   that the "compat22" distribution needs to be installed even
   though it has, indeed, been installed.
</strong>

Fix: The problem here is that though the compatibility a.out libraries
     may have been installed from compat22 and as part of the XFree86
     distribution, the a.out library (ldconfig) cache has not yet been
     built given that this doesn't happen until the system has booted
     completely at least once.  This causes packages which require the
     old a.out libraries (like netscape) to get confused if they're
     installed before that has occurred.  To work around the problem,
     simply complete the installation as normal and come up fully,
     then re-run /stand/sysinstall (or use the pkg_add(1) command
     directly) to re-install the failing package(s).
