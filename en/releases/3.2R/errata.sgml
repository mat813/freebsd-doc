---- Security Advisories:

Current active security advisories for 3.2:     None

---- System Update Information:

<strong>o    The compat20 and compat21 distributions install themselves into
/usr/lib/compat.  The compat20/compat21 distributions are a.out libraries,
thus they should live in /usr/lib/compat/aout to match the
"ldconfig_paths_aout" configuration in /etc/defaults/rc.conf.</strong>
                                                                              
Fix: cd /usr/lib/compat
     mkdir -p aout
     mv lib*.so.*.* aout

<strong>o /usr/bin/gdb crashes when debugging core files from static programs</strong>

Fix: This was corrected in revision 1.3.2.2 of solib.c. Obtain the fixed
version via CVSup (see instructions in handbook) or apply <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/src/contrib/gdb/gdb/solib.c.diff?r1=1.3.2.1&amp;r2=1.3.2.2">the patch</a>
from our CVSweb service.
