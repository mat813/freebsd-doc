---- Security Advisories:

Current active security advisories for 3.2:     None

---- System Update Information:

<strong>o    The compat20 and compat21 distributions install themselves into
/usr/lib/compat.  The compat20/compat21 distributions are a.out libraries,
thus they should live in /usr/lib/compat/aout to match the
"ldconfig_paths_aout" configuration in /etc/defaults/rc.conf.</strong>
                                                                              
Fix: cd /usr/lib/compat
     mkdir -p aout
     mv lib*.so.*.* aout
