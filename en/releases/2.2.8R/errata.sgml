be considered the definitive place to look *first* before reporting

file recently, check it again before filing a bug report.  Any
changes to this file are also automatically emailed to:

For 2.2.8 security advisories, see:

<a href="ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/">ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/</a>

For the latest information.

---- Security Advisories:

Current active security advisories for 2.2.8:   None

---- System Update Information:

<strong>o /usr/sbin/sysctl is an invalid link and whereis(1) doesn't work.</strong>

Fix: sysctl(8) has actually moved to /sbin/sysctl.  Simply create
     a symbolic link for compatability purposes as follows:

        ln -sf /sbin/sysctl /usr/sbin
 
     or syncronize your sources with 2.2-stable and rebuild/install
     from /usr/src/usr.bin/whereis/ and just rm /usr/sbin/sysctl  

<strong>o    /usr/share/doc/FAQ is in spanish.</strong>

Fix: This was a build failure which affected only the FAQ and has since
     been fixed.  If you are already cvsup/CTM'ing the doc-all tag then
     you can simply remake and install the FAQ from sources, otherwise
     grab ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/docs/FAQ.tar.gz and unpack
     as follows:  tar --unlink -xvzf FAQ.tar.gz -C /usr/share/doc
     to get an english FAQ.
