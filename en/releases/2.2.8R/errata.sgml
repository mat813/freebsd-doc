For the latest information.

---- Security Advisories:

Current active security advisories for 2.2.8:   None

---- System Update Information:

<strong>o /usr/sbin/sysctl is an invalid link.</strong>

Fix: sysctl(8) has actually moved to /sbin/sysctl.  Simply remove
     /usr/sbin/sysctl as it was included accidently in the
     bin distribution and is not necessary.
