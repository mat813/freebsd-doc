<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>This is a specific schedule for the release of FreeBSD 5.3.  For
  more general information about the release engineering process,
  please see the <a href="&base;/releng/index.html">Release
  Engineering</a> section of the web site.</p>

<p>General discussions about the release engineering process or
  quality assurance issues should be sent to the public <a
  href="mailto:FreeBSD-qa@FreeBSD.org">FreeBSD-qa</a> mailing list.
  <a
  href="&base;/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/faq/misc.html#DEFINE-MFC">MFC</a>
  requests should be sent to <a
  href="mailto:re@FreeBSD.org">re@FreeBSD.org</a>.</p>

<p>FreeBSD 5.3 will be the first release from the RELENG_5 branch and thus
  will also be the first 5-STABLE release.</p>

<p>The current release engineering <a
  href="&base;/releases/5.3R/todo.html">TODO list</a> is also available.
  This list is updated periodically through the release cycle.</p>
