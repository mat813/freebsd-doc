  <tr>
    <td>GDB thread support</td>
    <td>&status.wip;</td>
    <td>&a.davidxu;, &a.marcel;</td>
    <td>With improved support for threading primitives, support is now
      required to ease debugging of threaded applications.  Ideally,
      this support will work for both libthr and libkse threading
      models.</td>

    <td>&a.rwatson;, &a.markm;</td>
    <td>Entropy harvesting in the interrupt and incoming packet paths
      currently involves a large number of mutex operations.  In order to
      improve performance, it is desirable to reduce the number of mutex
      operations substantially.  Work is in progress to improve the
      harvesting code along these lines, but has not yet been properly
      measured, and therefore not yet merged to CVS.</td>

    <td>Reports of tcp_output() spinning; socket buffer corruption</td>
    <td>&status.wip;</td>
    <td>&a.rwatson;</td>
    <td>There have been reports of occasional corruption of socket buffers
       and/or spinning in tcp_output().  This may have been the result of
       missing socket buffer locking in tcp_output(), which has now been
       corrected in 6.x, and will be merged to 5.x shortly.</td>

    <td>Reports of sodealloc() panic under heavy load</td>
    <td>&status.wip;</td>
    <td>&a.rwatson;, &a.green;</td>
    <td>There have been reports of a so_count invariant violation in
       sofree(), which may relate to race conditions in sofree() against
       accept(), which were recently corrected in 6.x, with an intent to
       merge to 5.x shortly.  It has not yet been confirmed that the race
       fix corrects the symptom, as it takes several days to reproduce in
       high load environments, and has not yet been reproduced by the
       FreeBSD release engineerig team in testing.</td>

    <td>Problems with multicast and setuid binaries/daemons</td>

    <td>There have been reports that multicast socket options on raw sockets
      no longer work properly with daemons changing privilege or setuid
      binaries.  These symptoms have been tracked down to bugs relating to
      permitting limited use of raw sockets in jail().  A patch correcting
      these problems has been posted for review, but not yet been merged to
      6.x or 5.x.  It will be merged shortly.</td>

    <td>Reports of hangs using i4b (isdn4bsd)</td>
    <td>&status.wip;</td>
    <td>&a.rwatson;</td>
    <td>There have been reports of system hangs while using ISDN with the
      i4b ISDN framework on SMP systems.  These likely result from
      insufficient synchronization in the i4b implementation when runnning
      without the Giant lock over the network stack.  The workaround until
      this is fixed is to re-assert the Giant lock over the stack when
      i4b is compiled into the kernel; this has been committed to 6.x and
      will be merged to 5.x shortly.</td>

    <td>Almost all process debugging tools have been updated to use
      non-procfs kernel primitives, with the exception of truss(1).
      As procfs is considered deprecated due to its inherent security
      risks, it is highly desirable to update truss to operate in
      a post-procfs world.  &a.des; had prototype patches; &a.robert;
      is developing and testing patches now.  Support for system
      call tracing has been added to ptrace().</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>FAST_IPSEC and KAME compatibility</td>
    <td>&status.new;</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>FAST_IPSEC currently cannot be used directly with the KAME IPv6
      implementation, requiring an additional level of IP tunnel
      indirection to protect IPv6 packets when using hardware crypto
      acceleration.  This issue must be resolved so that the two
      services may more easily be used together.  Among other things,
      this will require a careful review of the handling of mbuf
      header copying and m_tag support in the KAME IPv6 code.</td>

    <td>rpc.lockd(8) stability</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>A process cannot be interrupted while waiting on a lock.  Fixing
      this requires that the RPC code be taught how to deal with lock
      cancellation and interruption events.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Revised kld build infrastructure</td>
    <td>&status.new;</td>
    <td>&a.peter;</td>
    <td>Kernel modules are currently built independently from a kernel
      configuration, and independently from one another, resulting in
      substantially redundant compilation of objects, as well as the
      inability to easily manage compile-time options for kernel
      objects (such as MAC, PAE, etc) that may require conditional
      compilation in the kernel modules.  In order to improve build
      performance and better support options of this sort, the
      KLD build infrastructure needs to be revamped.  &a.peter; has
      done some initial prototyping, and should be contacted before
      starting on this work.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Merge of Darwin msdosfs, other fixes</td>
    <td>&status.new;</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>Apple's Darwin operating system has fairly extensive improvements
      to msdosfs and other kernel services; these fixes must be reviewed
      and merged to the FreeBSD tree.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>Race conditions in truss</td>
  <td>Errata candidate</td>
  <td>&a.robert;</td>
  <td>Truss appears to contain a race condition during the start-up of
    debugging, which can result in truss failing to attach to the process
    before it exits.  The symptom is that truss reports that it cannot
    open the procfs node supporting the process being debugged.  A bug
    also appears to exist where in truss will hang if execve() returns
    ENOENT.  A further race appears to exist in which truss will return
    "PIOCWAIT: Input/output error" occasionally on startup.  The fix
    for this sufficiently changes process execution handling that we
    will defer the fix to post-5.0 and consider this errata.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>More truss problems</td>
    <td>&status.new;</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>Truss appears to have another problem.  It is repeatable by
      running "truss -f fsck -p /", suspending it with ^Z, and then
      killing truss.  It will leave behind the fsck processes which
      will be unkillable.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>ACL_MASK override of umask support in UFS</td>
    <td>&status.new;</td>
    <td>&a.rwatson;</td>
    <td>Many systems supporting POSIX.1e ACLs permit a minor violation
      to that specification, in which the ACL_MASK entry overrides the
      umask, rather than being intersected with it.  The resulting
      semantics can be useful in group-oriented environments, and as
      such would be very helpful on FreeBSD.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>filedesc LOR</td>
    <td>&status.new;</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>The LOR reported in PR kern/55175 needs to be fixed.  Filedesc locking
      needs to be heavily reviewed in general.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>MAC support for NFS Server</td>
    <td>&status.new;</td>
    <td>&a.rwatson;</td>
    <td>Currently, MAC protections are enforced only on locally originated
      file system operations (VOPs), and not on RPCs generated via the
      NFS server.  Improvements in NFS server credential handling are
      required to correct this problem, as well as the introduction of
      new entry points to properly label NFS credentials and perform
      enforcement properly.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>busdma in all PCI drivers</td>
    <td>&status.wip;</td>

      characters on the keyboard produces garbage.  Problem reported
      by &a.kris;.  Debugging difficult due to lack of this particular
