    <td>PREEMPTION appears to increase the chances of triggering a race
      condition in the thread context management and scheduling code.
      Patches to mitigate the problem have been developed, with on-going
      work to come up with the correct solution prior to 5.3.</td>

    <td>&a.kuriyama; has reported problems with NFS over IPv6 not functioning
      correctly as of the improved NFS support for disconnection changes.
      &a.dwhite; has tracked down the source of the problem (EMSGSIZE being
      returned by IPv6 UDP send routine due to fragmentation), and is
      currently exploring possible fixes.  A patch has been generated and
      sent to the KAME team for review.</td>

      handed off to ether_demux(), at which point it may have been free()'d
      back to the mbuf allocator.  It also passes in a pointer to the mbuf
      itself, rather than ethernet frame header.</td>

    <td>There are reports that racoon is unable to complete IKE negotiation
      due to a send to the pfkey socket returning ENOBUFS.  This appears to
      be a result of an incorrect assumption about mbuf data size due to a
      change resulting from mbuma.</td>

      device detaches, especially USB hubs.  Since detaching a USB device is
      a common event, this must be fixed for the release.</td>

    <td>&status.wip;</td>
    <td>&a.davidxu;, &a.marcel;</td>

      required to ease debugging of threaded applications.  Ideally,
      this support will work for both libthr and libkse threading
      models.</td>

      disk and label management tool set.  These must be resolved for
      5.3-RELEASE.</td>

    <td>Entropy harvesting in the interrupt and incoming packet paths
      currently involves a large number of mutex operations.  In order to
      improve performance, it is desirable to reduce the number of mutex
      operations substantially.  Work is in progress to improve the
      harvesting code along these lines, but has not yet been properly
      measured, and therefore not yet merged to CVS.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>truss support for ptrace</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>Almost all process debugging tools have been updated to use
      non-procfs kernel primitives, with the exception of truss(1).
      As procfs is considered deprecated due to its inherent security
      risks, it is highly desirable to update truss to operate in
      a post-procfs world.  &a.des; had prototype patches; &a.robert;
      is developing and testing patches now.  Support for system
      call tracing has been added to ptrace().</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>FAST_IPSEC and KAME compatibility</td>
    <td>&status.new;</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>FAST_IPSEC currently cannot be used directly with the KAME IPv6
      implementation, requiring an additional level of IP tunnel
      indirection to protect IPv6 packets when using hardware crypto
      acceleration.  This issue must be resolved so that the two
      services may more easily be used together.  Among other things,
      this will require a careful review of the handling of mbuf
      header copying and m_tag support in the KAME IPv6 code.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>rpc.lockd(8) stability</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>A process cannot be interrupted while waiting on a lock.  Fixing
      this requires that the RPC code be taught how to deal with lock
      cancellation and interruption events.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Revised kld build infrastructure</td>
    <td>&status.new;</td>
    <td>&a.peter;</td>
    <td>Kernel modules are currently built independently from a kernel
      configuration, and independently from one another, resulting in
      substantially redundant compilation of objects, as well as the
      inability to easily manage compile-time options for kernel
      objects (such as MAC, PAE, etc) that may require conditional
      compilation in the kernel modules.  In order to improve build
      performance and better support options of this sort, the
      KLD build infrastructure needs to be revamped.  &a.peter; has
      done some initial prototyping, and should be contacted before
      starting on this work.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Merge of Darwin msdosfs, other fixes</td>
    <td>&status.new;</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>Apple's Darwin operating system has fairly extensive improvements
      to msdosfs and other kernel services; these fixes must be reviewed
      and merged to the FreeBSD tree.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>Race conditions in truss</td>
  <td>Errata candidate</td>
  <td>&a.robert;</td>
  <td>Truss appears to contain a race condition during the start-up of
    debugging, which can result in truss failing to attach to the process
    before it exits.  The symptom is that truss reports that it cannot
    open the procfs node supporting the process being debugged.  A bug
    also appears to exist where in truss will hang if execve() returns
    ENOENT.  A further race appears to exist in which truss will return
    "PIOCWAIT: Input/output error" occasionally on startup.  The fix
    for this sufficiently changes process execution handling that we
    will defer the fix to post-5.0 and consider this errata.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>More truss problems</td>
    <td>&status.new;</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>Truss appears to have another problem.  It is repeatable by
      running "truss -f fsck -p /", suspending it with ^Z, and then
      killing truss.  It will leave behind the fsck processes which
      will be unkillable.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>ACL_MASK override of umask support in UFS</td>
    <td>&status.new;</td>
    <td>&a.rwatson;</td>
    <td>Many systems supporting POSIX.1e ACLs permit a minor violation
      to that specification, in which the ACL_MASK entry overrides the
      umask, rather than being intersected with it.  The resulting
      semantics can be useful in group-oriented environments, and as
      such would be very helpful on FreeBSD.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>filedesc LOR</td>
    <td>&status.new;</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>The LOR reported in PR kern/55175 needs to be fixed.  Filedesc locking
      needs to be heavily reviewed in general.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>MAC support for NFS Server</td>
    <td>&status.new;</td>
    <td>&a.rwatson;</td>
    <td>Currently, MAC protections are enforced only on locally originated
      file system operations (VOPs), and not on RPCs generated via the
      NFS server.  Improvements in NFS server credential handling are
      required to correct this problem, as well as the introduction of
      new entry points to properly label NFS credentials and perform
      enforcement properly.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>busdma in all PCI drivers</td>
    <td>&status.wip;</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>All PCI drivers must use busdma for DMA; no use of vtophys() will
      be permitted for any recent device driver.  ISA drivers may be 
      exempt.</td>

    <td>&a.scottl;, &a.gibbs;</td>
    <td>For kernel API/ABI compatibility reasons, it would be desirable to
      have the CAM locking strategy determined and loosely implemented for
      5.3.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>syscons not working on Sparc64 Ultra-30</td>
    <td>&status.new;</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>When running syscons on an Ultra-30 with Creator-3D typing
      characters on the keyboard produces garbage.  Problem reported
      by &a.kris;.  Debugging difficult due to lack of this particular
      configuration among developers and problem isn't present on similar
      hardware (e.g. no problem on Ultra-60 w/Creator-3D).</td>

      copyout() while holding the global ifnet list mutex.  This generates a
      witness warning in the event that copyout() generates a page fault,
      and risks more serious problems.  A patch has been committed to HEAD
      and RELENG_5, but requires testing.</td>

    <td>There are reports of applications wedging in poll() and select()
      while running the network stack without the Giant lock.  A recent
      sleepq change appears to have caused some of the observed problems
      to go away (others are difficult to test for due to recent SMP
      instability).  A fix has been committed to CVS HEAD and merged to
      RELENG_5 and appears to resolve problems with poll(); we are waiting
      for feedback that it has corrected the reported problems with select()
      also before moving this to "testing" status.</td>
