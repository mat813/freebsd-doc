<h3>Required features for 5.3-RELEASE</h3>

<table border=1 width="100%">
  <tr><th>Issue</th><th>Status</th><th>Responsible</th><th>Description</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>SCHED_ULE as the default scheduler</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>&a.jeff;</td>
    <td>SCHED_ULE provides better interactivity, higher performance, and the
      ability to support pinning and affinity.  Basic HTT scheduling policies
      should be in place for 5.3 also.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>KSE as the default threads library</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>&a.davidxu;, &a.deischen;</td>
    <td>KSE has matured to the point of being more stable and POSIX-compliant
      than the traditional libc_r.  All Tier-1 platforms <b>MUST</b> have
      stable KSE support for 5.3 in order to support a consistent transition.
      Additionally, all ports that depend on the pthreads API must be modified
      to properly detect and support the default threading library.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Updated binutils for all platforms</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>&a.obrien;</td>
    <td>Binutils needs updating in order to support new platforms, newer GDB
      versions, and Thread Local Storage.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>BIND9 import into 5-CURRENT</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>BIND9 must be imported for 5.3-RELEASE.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Completed compiler support for dynamic </td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>&a.obrien;</td>
    <td>All platforms but IA64 have modifications to support /libexec/ld.so
      in the gcc base source tree; these changes must be merged back into
      the FSF tree and brought into FreeBSD on the vendor branch for
      5.3-RELEASE.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Per-platform Thread-Local Storage</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>To complete support for thread-local storage on FreeBSD,
      per-architecture changes must be made.  Currently pending
      platforms are amd64, alpha, ia64, i386, sparc64, and powerpc.</td>
