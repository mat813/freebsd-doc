<h3>Goals</h3>

<p>As part of our on-going effort to improve the release engineering
  process, we have identified several areas that need significant
  quality assurance testing during the release candidate phase.
  Below, we've listed the changes in &rel; that we feel merit
  the most attention due to their involving substantial changes to the
  system, or having arrived late in the development cycle leading up
  to the release.  In general, our goal in the QA process is to
  attempt to check a number of things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The system has not regressed with respects to stability, correctness,
    interoperability, or performance of features present in prior
    releases.<br><br></li>

  <li>New features result in the desired improvement in stability,
    correctness, interoperability, or performance.</li>
</ul>

<p>To effectively determine this, it's desirable to test the system in
  a diverse set of environments, applying a wide set of workloads,
  forcing the system to operate both within and outside its normal
  specification.  Particular focus should often be placed on the
  continuing (or new) capability of the system to perform correctly
  when used in concert with systems from other vendors.</p>

<h3>Features to explore carefully:</h3>

<ul>

  <li><p>PPP.  A number of significant PPP changes were merged to
    -STABLE before the code freeze.  In particular, the following
    changes were made :</p>
    <ul>
      <li>IPv6 support</li>
      <li>Better RADIUS support (including MS-CHAP)</li>
      <li>Improved handling of bad negotiation options</li>
      <li>Improved negotiation diagnostics</li>
      <li>Improved sockaddr (RTAX) parsing</li>
      <li>More consistent compile time options (NOXXX to compile something out)</li>
      <li>More available macros</li>
      <li>Firewall punching</li>
      <li>Improved ``proxy'' and ``proxyall'' handling</li>
      <li>Handle connected UDP sockets on descriptor 0 in -direct mode</li>
      <li>Fix a load of typos</li>
      <li>Update to internal version 3.1</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>IPFilter has recently been updated to version 3.4.29 and has not
    yet been thoroughly tested in -STABLE.</li>

  <li><strong>ahc</strong> and <strong>ahd</strong> Adaptec SCSI
    drivers: There has been a major update to the <tt>ahc</tt> and
    <tt>ahd</tt> device drivers.  These drivers have not yet been
    thoroughly tested in -STABLE.</li>

  <li>bzip2 packages.  bzip2 packages are now used by default.
    More testing of the pkg* tools is needed.</li>

  <li>ATA.  There were some problems with tagged queuing and some
    CDROM read operations with the ATA stack in FreeBSD 4.6.  These
    problems were fixed in 4.6.2, but more testing on different
    hardware is still needed.</li>

  <li>Sendmail has been updated to 8.12.5.  This should be a very
    stable bugfix release, but sendmail users are encouraged to help
    test this before 4.7 is released.</li>

</ul>

<p>The <a href="../../relnotes.html">release notes</a> will always be
  a good place to look for things to test.</p>
