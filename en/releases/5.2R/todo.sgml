<h1>Open Issues</h1>

<p>This is a list of open issues that need to be resolved for FreeBSD
  5.2.  If you have any updates for this list, please e-mail
  re@FreeBSD.org.</p>

<h3>Must Resolve Issues for 5.2-RELEASE</h3>

<table border=1 width="100%">
  <tr><th>Issue</th><th>Status</th><th>Responsible</th><th>Description</th>
      </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Production-quality M:N threading</td>
    <td>In progress</td>
    <td>&a.julian;, &a.davidxu;, &a.deischen;</td>
    <td>KSE M:N threading support is reaching experimental yet usable
      status on i386 for 5.1-RELEASE.  M:N threading should be
      productionable and usable on all platforms by 5.2-RELEASE.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>16-bit CDB addressing for CAM</td>
    <td>In progress</td>
    <td>&a.ken;</td>
    <td>CAM currently supports only 12-bit CDBs, placing a 2TB bound
      on addressable disk storage using CAM.  With support for large
      file systems with UFS2, and large partitions using GPT, CAM
      now needs to be updated to support these devices.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>FAST_IPSEC and KAME compatibility</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>FAST_IPSEC currently cannot be used directly with the KAME IPv6
      implementation, requiring an additional level of IP tunnel
      indirection to protect IPv6 packets when using hardware crypto
      acceleration.  This issue must be resolved so that the two
      services may more easily be used together.  Among other things,
      this will require a careful review of the handling of mbuf
      header copying and m_tag support in the KAME IPv6 code.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>KAME Synchronization</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>The FreeBSD KAME IPv6 code is now substantially dated with
      respect to the KAME vendor source.  The FreeBSD Project needs
      to take initiative in driving the merge of new bug fixes,
      features, et al.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>truss support for ptrace</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>Almost all process debugging tools have been updated to use
      non-procfs kernel primitives, with the exception of truss(1).
      As procfs is considered deprecated due to its inherrent security
      risks, it is highly desirable to update truss to operate in
      a post-procfs world.  &a.des; had "work in progress" patches
      that will need to be completed and committed.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Merge of Darwin msdosfs, other fixes</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>Apple's Darwin operating system has fairly extensive improvements
      to msdosfs and other kernel services; these fixes must be reviewed
      and merged to the FreeBSD tree.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>MAC support for NFS Server</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>&a.rwatson;</td>
    <td>Currently, MAC protections are enforced only on locally originated
      file system operations (VOPs), and not on RPCs generated via the
      NFS server.  Improvements in NFS server credential handling are
      required to correct this problem, as well as the introduction of
      new entry points to properly label NFS credentials and perform
      enforcement properly.</td>
