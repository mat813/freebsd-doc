    <td>devfs umount panic</td>
    <td>&status.new;</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>There is a race condition between device removal and devfs
      umounts that causes "Memory modified after free" panics.  Can
      be reproduced by doing 'mdconfig -u' concurrently with unmounting
      a devfs instance.</td>

    <td>/dev/kmem panic</td>
    <td>&status.new;</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>Kris has noticed panics on SMP machines when there was ABI
      breakage of libkvm and world was not rebuilt and utilities like
      fstat were used.  This suggests panics can be caused by incorrect
      accesses to /dev/kmem.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>KLDs on sparc64</td>
    <td>&status.new;</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>On sparc64 machines with more than 4Gb memory KLDs are not usable
      and will panic the system.  The problem is reportedly with how the
      KLDs are compiled, it only works if the code ends up below 4G.</td>

    <td>Max RAM on sparc64</td>
    <td>&status.new;</td>

    <td>Maximum RAM on sparc64 appears to be limited to 16Gb.</td>

    <td>make -jN</td>
    <td>&status.new;</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>Doing 'make -jN', then suspending/resuming it may result in make
      reporting it lost child process(es).</td>

  <tr>
    <td>OpenBSM</td>
    <td>&status.deferred;</td>
    <td>&a.rwatson;</td>
    <td>The integration of OpenBSM is waiting on some final licensing hurdles.
      Once those are cleared, it will be a very desirable feature for &local.rel;.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>update sysinstall disk labeling</td>
    <td>&status.wip;</td>
    <td>&a.rodrigc;</td>
    <td>Sysinstall could use the same fixes recently made to fdisk so it
      plays nice with GEOM and disk labeling.  This does not cause problems
      during install because nothing on the disk is mounted when its label
      is being manipulated but it can cause problems if sysinstall gets
      used on a live system to adjust labels on existing disks which
      sys-admins tend to do.</td>
