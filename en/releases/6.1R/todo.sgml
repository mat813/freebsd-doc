      href="http://www.freebsd.org/projects/ideas/#p-smpinstall">ideas
      page</a>.</em>  Right now we only install a UP kernel, for performance
      reasons. We should be able to package both a UP and SMP kernel
      into the release bits, and have sysinstall install both. It
      should also select the correct one for the target system and
      make that the default on boot. The easiest way to do this would
      be to have sysinstall boot an SMP kernel and then look at the
      hw.ncpu sysctl. The only problem is being able to have
      sysinstall fall back to booting a UP kernel for itself if the
      SMP one fails. This can probably be 'faked' by setting one of
      the SMP-disabling variables in the loader. But in any case, the
      point is to make the process Just Work for the user, without the
      user needing to know arcane loader/sysctl knobs. SMP laptops are
      here, and we should be ready to support SMP out-of-the-box.</td>
