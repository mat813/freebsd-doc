      Increasing the kern.maxswzone tunable would be a workaround

filesystem corruption reported by many users in which the 'used' space
on a filesystem is negative; fsck -f is needed to correct this.</td>

    <td>SMP kernels for install</td>
    <td>&status.unknown;</td>
    <td></td>

    <td><em>From the <a
      href="http://www.freebsd.org/projects/ideas/#p-smpinstall">ideas
      page</a>.</em>  Right now we only install a UP kernel, for performance
      reasons. We should be able to package both a UP and SMP kernel
      into the release bits, and have sysinstall install both. It
      should also select the correct one for the target system and
      make that the default on boot. The easiest way to do this would
      be to have sysinstall boot an SMP kernel and then look at the
      hw.ncpu sysctl. The only problem is being able to have
      sysinstall fall back to booting a UP kernel for itself if the
      SMP one fails. This can probably be 'faked' by setting one of
      the SMP-disabling variables in the loader. But in any case, the
      point is to make the process Just Work for the user, without the
      user needing to know arcane loader/sysctl knobs. SMP laptops are
      here, and we should be ready to support SMP out-of-the-box.</td>

    <td>Improve kbdmux</td>

    <td>&a.emax;</td>
    <td><em>From the <a
      href="http://www.freebsd.org/projects/ideas/#p-kbdmux">ideas
      page</a>.</em> We need this for the growing number of systems
      that assume that USB is the primary keyboard. Current status
      appears to be that the kbdmux driver breaks very easily. We need
      this working well enough where it can be enabled by default, and
      all attached keyboards Just Work.</td>

    <td>&a.kris; reports configuring a 74GB swap-backed md on sparc64 that

      swap was slowly filling as more of the md was dirtied).</td>

    <td>&a.kris; has noticed panics on SMP machines when there was ABI
      breakage of libkvm and world was not rebuilt and utilities like
      fstat were used.  This suggests panics can be caused by incorrect
      accesses to /dev/kmem.</td>

    <td>&status.wip;</td>
    <td>&a.rodrigc;</td>
    <td>Sysinstall could use the same fixes recently made to fdisk so it
      plays nice with GEOM and disk labeling.  This does not cause problems
      during install because nothing on the disk is mounted when its label
      is being manipulated but it can cause problems if sysinstall gets
      used on a live system to adjust labels on existing disks which
      sys-admins tend to do.</td>
