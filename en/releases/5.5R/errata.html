<p>This document lists errata items for FreeBSD 5.5-RELEASE, containing significant
information discovered after the release or too late in the release cycle to be otherwise
included in the release documentation. This information includes security advisories, as
well as news relating to the software or documentation that could affect its operation or
usability. An up-to-date version of this document should always be consulted before
installing this version of FreeBSD.</p>

<p>This errata document for FreeBSD 5.5-RELEASE will be maintained until the end-of-life
date for the 5-STABLE branch. As of the release date, this date was estimated to be 31
May 2008. The current end-of-life state for the various FreeBSD branches can be found at
<a href="http://security.freebsd.org/"
target="_top">http://security.freebsd.org/</a>.</p>

<h2 class="SECT1"><a id="INTRO" name="INTRO">1 Introduction</a></h2>

<p>This errata document contains ``late-breaking news'' about FreeBSD 5.5-RELEASE. Before
installing this version, it is important to consult this document to learn about any
post-release discoveries or problems that may already have been found and fixed.</p>

<p>Any version of this errata document actually distributed with the release (for
example, on a CDROM distribution) will be out of date by definition, but other copies are
kept updated on the Internet and should be consulted as the ``current errata'' for this
release. These other copies of the errata are located at <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/"
target="_top">http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/</a>, plus any sites which keep up-to-date
mirrors of this location.</p>

<p>Source and binary snapshots of FreeBSD 5-STABLE also contain up-to-date copies of this
document (as of the time of the snapshot).</p>

<p>For a list of all FreeBSD CERT security advisories, see <a

<p>(24 May 2006) The NFSv4 client in 5.5-RELEASE is an unfinished prototype, and there
are a number of issues with it (many documented in the FreeBSD GNATS database) that make
it unusable in many situations. Given the state of 5-STABLE development, it is unlikely
that these will be resolved on this development branch.</p>
