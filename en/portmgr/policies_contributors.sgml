<p>These are the time periods that apply to maintainer and committer
responses to issues brought to their attention via email.</p>

<a name="pr_timeout"></a>
<h3>Problem Report (PR) Timeouts</h3>

<p>The time limit for a maintainer to respond to a PR is two weeks.
  After that period, if it is a minor change, any ports committer can
  commit the change.  If it is a major change (e.g. would require a
  regression run), please contact portmgr first.</p>

<p>Since GNATS does not automatically notify maintainers of PRs, please
  check to see whether or not the maintainer knows about the PR before
  declaring a timeout.  You can generally tell this from the Audit-Trail
  and Cc: lines in the PR.</p>

<a name="maintainer_reset"></a>
<h3>Maintainer Reset</h3>

<p>The time limit for a maintainer to respond to port problems (such
  as build errors, PRs, and needed updates) is three months.  After that
  period, any ports committer can reset the maintainer.  If you are
  a committer and concerned about whether you are doing the right
  thing, please contact portmgr.</p>

<p>This period may be shortened by portmgr if the email address returns
  with a hard bounce.  In this case, it is probably desirable to reset
  all the maintainer's ports and change any PRs set to 'feedback' back
  to 'open'.</p>

<a name="commit_privileges"></a>
<h3>Commit Privileges</h3>

<p>The time limit for a committer to keep commit rights within the
  ports tree ("commit bit") is one year.  portmgr will contact the
  committer by email before invoking this limit.</p>
