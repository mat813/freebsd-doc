<p>While still many people use RELENG_4, it is EOD.  Portmgr has set the
  following policies with regard to EOL/EOS of this branch and kindly asks
  developers to implement these:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We keep building 4.11 packages as long as we have the resources.
    4.X package builds will be deprioritised though, meaning they may not be
    rebuilt as frequently.</li>
  <li>We will continue to support the 4.X infrastructure until RELENG_4 EOL
    (31&nbsp;January&nbsp;2007) by building the INDEX on RELENG_4 for use by
    <i>make fetchindex</i>, and making sure that the Ports Collection
    infrastructure (bsd.port.mk, etc) continues to function on RELENG_4,
    subject to the reduced testing that this branch will receive.  This means
    that problems may be noticed only after the fact and may require community
    support to develop and test fixes.</li>
  <li>We do not require committers/maintainers to support 4.X, but ports will
    still be required to be marked BROKEN/IGNORE if they do not build/run.</li>
  <li>Port maintainers are strongly encouraged to accept patches from the
    community that allow their ports to build and run on 4.X.  However, since
    running on 4.X is no longer a requirement, maintainers may use their
    discretion in cases where a proposed patch would be disruptive to other
    supported FreeBSD branches, or would unreasonably impede ongoing
    maintenance of the port.</li>
  <li>We will continue to accept patches for Ports Collection infrastructure
    (bsd.port.mk, etc).</li>
  <li>We encourage all users and developers to migrate to the FreeBSD 6.X
    branch, which is a stable and mature platform, and is now the 'reference'
    FreeBSD branch for the Ports Collection.</li>
</ul>
