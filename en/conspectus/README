To update a conspectus from a contributor, do the following:

  1.  Place the .sgml file in the appropriate <list>/<year>/<month>/
      directory.  Create the directories as necessary.

  2.  Update the Makefile in the same directory to include the new file.

  3.  Run make(1) in the directory to confirm that the file builds 
      correctly.

  4.  cd(1) up a level, so you're in <list>/<year>/, and edit index.sgml
      to include the contents of the new conspectus.  Do this by cutting
      and pasting the TOC from the new file in to index.sgml.  We do things
      in reverse chronological order (i.e., most recent first)

        *  Be sure and update the links in the pasted TOC, as they will
           need to include the month/<file>.sgml name as well.  A quick
           way to do this is to search and replace 

             "#

           with

             "<month>/<date>.sgml#

           in the file.

        *  Make sure the <h2> contains a link to the whole file.

  5.  cd(1) up two levels, and edit the main conspectus/index.sgml file.
      Update the link to the latest Conspectus
