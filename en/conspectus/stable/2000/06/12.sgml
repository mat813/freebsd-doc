    <p>On June 9, 2000, <a href="mailto:kris@FreeBSD.ORG">[Kris Kennaway]</a>
       proclaimed that he had merged with -stable the OpenSSH 2.1.0 code
       from -current.</p> 

    <p>He also provided the following information:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><i>The major new feature of OpenSSH 2.x is support for the 
	  SSH2 protocol and DSA keys, freeing it from the dependency
	  on RSAREF for USA people. It interoperates well with the 
	  ssh2 port and other SSH2 clients/servers - see 
	  <a href="http://www.openssh.com">http://www.openssh.com</a>
	  for more interop details. Another new feature is support for
	  OPIE passwords in SSH1 mode.</i></p>

      <p><i>Missing from OpenSSH 2.1.0 is support for OPIE and Kerberos in
	  SSH2 mode, which will be hopefully added later.</i></p>
      
      <p><i>For more information on how to use OpenSSH 2.1, see the
	  manpages, the file /usr/src/crypto/openssh/README.openssh2
	  and <a href="http://www.openssh.com">www.openssh.com</a>.
	  Server DSA key generation is automatic the next time you
	  boot with sshd_enable=YES in rc.conf, or you can do it by
	  hand (see the above README).</i></p>
    </blockquote>
 
    <p>Owing to some syntax errors, the OpenSSH MFC caused a temporary
      breach of -STABLE; the difficulty, however, was soon overcome.</p>

    <p>On June 8, 2000, <a href="mailto:green@FreeBSD.ORG">[Brian Fundakowski
	Feldman]</a> made the following announcement:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><i>Per request of users and the security officer, I've 
	  backported the changes from 4.0/5.0 which allow 
	  administrative control over the socket resources a user can
	  allocate.  I need testers to get this done before
	  3.5-RELEASE, as my crash-box is -CURRENT.  I think I have
	  caught all of the problematic parts of the code and merged
	  things correctly, so I do not _expect_ anything to go wrong.</i></p>
      
      <p><i>The big problem is that people are using the DoS (indeed,
	  it has just been reposted on BugTraq for some unknown 
	  reason), and something must be done to prevent a user from
	  crashing the system like that.  Changing the limit is as 
	  easy as modifying /etc/login.conf, and a default value
	  should be in  place. I don't know what the default value
	  should be, so I invite estimates on how much socket buffer
	  space a user really needs.</i></p>
      
      <p><i>The patch, which will necessitate both a make world and 
	  new kernel/modules build, is located at:
	  <a
	    href="http://people.FreeBSD.org/~green/sbsize_etc.RELENG_3.patch">http://people.FreeBSD.org/~green/sbsize_etc.RELENG_3.patch</a>.</i></p>
      
      <p><i>In addition to the sbsize change, there's a relatively 
	  minor change to struct socket which does break binary
	  compatibility of kernel modules if they use that member
	  (so_cred). Anything groveling in the kernel memory, like
	  pidentd, would need to be recompiled/modified, but pidentd
	  itself (now uses the proper interface to get the data it
	  needs.</i></p>
      
      <p><i>So, anyone who can, test it out and report back. 
	  I need to get this done within the week or so :)</i></p>

    <p>On June 8, 2000, <a
	href="mailto:yokota@zodiac.mech.utsunomiya-u.ac.jp">[Kazutaka
	Yokota]</a> posted a patch for the psm driver. The "diff" in question,

      issue; furthermore, it needed testing; finally, it had been designed
      with more general goals in mind.</p>
    
    <p>Incidentally,
      <a href="mailto:pir@pir.net">[Peter Radcliffe]</a>,
      <a href="http://docs.freebsd.org/cgi/getmsg.cgi?fetch=238074+0+archive/2000/freebsd-stable/20000611.freebsd-stable">in a letter of his</a>,   
      described another approach to the psmintr out of sync problem:
      
    <blockquote>
      <p><i>My workaround for this, for the moment, is to use the 
	  serial adaptor that came with the mouse and use it on the
	  first serial port. Works fine, but somewhat annoying to lose
	  a serial port ...</i></p>

    <p><a href="mailto:vladimir-bsd-stable@math.uic.edu">[Vladimir Egorin]</a>
       had been recording a number of inetd coredumps for the previous

    <p>It turned out that the coredumps were due to underscore

    <p>Next, he asked: </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><i>BTW, should the '_' character be considered a valid

    <p><a href="mailto:swb@grasslake.net">[Shawn Barnhart]</a>
      rejoined:</p>

    <blockquote> 
      <p><i>It seems like it would be safer for a client machine to

      <p><i>On the more sophisticated end you could do it as an SNMP 
	  trap, or you could just write the UPS status to a file on
	  the monitoring box and the clients could fetch the status
	  periodically and make their own decisions about what to do
	  when the power went off.</i></p>

    <p><a href="mailto:winter@jurai.net">[Matthew Dodd]</a>
      concluded the conversation by observing:</p>

    <p>The next day, <a href="mailto:djfast@telus.net">[Donald Fast]</a>,

      that it might correctly operate behind a firewall. At first, he
      thought that passive mode was broken, but, in an ensuing letter,
      he made it clear that it was not the case:</p>
    
    <blockquote>
      <p><i>Suppose I do:</i></p>

      <pre>      ftp ftp.freebsd.org</pre>

      <p><i>and log on as anonymous. When I type</i></p>

      <pre>      ls</pre>

      <p><i>I get the messages</i></p>

      <pre>      500 'EPSV': command not understood.
      500 'LPSV': command not understood.
      Passive mode refused.</pre>

      <p><i>This worked in earler versions of FreeBSD 4.0, even when
	  I had a firewall.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><a href="mailto:jim@thehousleys.net">[James Housley]</a>
      suggested:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><i>This is from /etc/login.conf:</i></p>

      <pre>default:\
      :copyright=/etc/COPYRIGHT:\
      :welcome=/etc/motd:\
      :setenv=MAIL=/var/mail/$,BLOCKSIZE=K,FTP_PASSIVE_MODE=NO:\</pre>

      <p><i>I changed FTP_PASSIVE_MODE=YES to NO and all was right in
	  the world </i></p>

      <p><i>Don't forget cap_mkdb.</i></p>
    </blockquote>   

    <p><a href="mailto:spork@super-g.com">[Charles Sprickman]</a>
      went on to say:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><i> If you pull the IPV6 stuff out of your kernel, ftp seems
	  to work fine, I assume it must "ifdef" the problematic parts
	  of the ftp program out. I have a number of machines running 
	  -stable and have no problems, but I also always comment out
	  the v6 stuff.</i></p> 

      <p><i> cap_mkdb is to be run like so whenever you've changed 
	  login.conf:</i></p>

    <pre>      "cap_mkdb /etc/login.conf".</pre>
      
      <p><i>You will have to log out (all the way to the login prompt
	  if you're at the console) and log back in for changes to
	  take effect. A reboot should not be necessary.</i></p>
