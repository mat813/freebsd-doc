    <h3><a name="1"></a>Nov 20 (3 posts):  <a href="http://docs.FreeBSD.org/cgi/getmsg.cgi?fetch=8998+0+current/freebsd-advocacy">About the Symbolism</a></h3>

    <p>Here we have <a href="mailto:posonsky@iname.ru">[Stanislav
      Posonsky]</a> asking us about the d&brvbar;mon logo, which he
      refers to as an "impish creature", and whether or not we should
      give up this "devilry" in favor of a more neutral symbol for our
      logo/image.</p>

    <p><a href="mailto:will@physics.purdue.edu">[Will Andrews]</a>
      replied, letting Stanislav know that this has been discussed
      <strong>MANY</strong> times, and gave us a nice explanation of why
      we like the d&brvbar;mon, and why we keep it.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><i>It is not an impish creature.  It's a daemon, which is a
	generic name for a server process, such as Apache, or inetd, or
	syslogd, etc.  The fork the daemon wields refers to the fork()
	system call.  As you can see, there is no relationship between
	Satanic images and our mascot.</i> - <a

    <h3><a name="2"></a>Nov 13 - Nov 16 (15 posts):  <a href="http://docs.FreeBSD.org/cgi/getmsg.cgi?fetch=19509+0+archive/2000/freebsd-advocacy/20001119.freebsd-advocacy">accessing portal site</a></h3>

    <p>Well, it seems we still haven't stopped discussing why this
      <a href="12.html#1">original post</a> shouldn't have been Cc'd
      to -advocacy.  A few good quotes this week:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><i>It's plain common sense to not Cc advocacy.  Apart from the
	unwanted implication that you're a spokesman for FreeBSD
	advocacy, there is a danger of the recipient of your mail
	getting submerged in a deluge of -advocacy replies.  Luckily,
	that didn't happen in this case.</i> - [<a
	href="mailto:Rahul.Siddharthan@ltp.ens.fr">Rahul
	Siddharthan]</a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p><i>No, he's just trying to get you to stop sending email that
	has the appearance of collusion with the FreeBSD Project.  If
	you want to send a "heads up" to a FreeBSD mailing list use BCC
	so the person or company you're sending the mail to will not
	misconstrue your message as coming from or being approved by the
	FreeBSD Project or Advocacy group.</i> - <a
	href="mailto:wes@softweyr.com">[Wes Peters]</a></p>

    <h3><a name="3"></a>Nov 13 - Nov 16 (20 posts): <a href="http://docs.FreeBSD.org/cgi/getmsg.cgi?fetch=76607+0+archive/2000/freebsd-advocacy/20001119.freebsd-advocacy">Any artists interested in doing a FreeBSD animated GIF banner?</a></h3>

    <p>We're still on the lookout for some new banner ads.  This week's
      unveilings:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a
	href="http://www.briz.net/mike/bnr-bsd-6.gif">http://www.briz.net/mike/bnr-bsd-6.gif</a></li>

    </ul>

    <p>But, <a href="mailto:wes@softweyr.com">[Wes Peters]</a> says:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><i>Except it still doesn't have beastie doing the Macarena.
	That would be cool.</i></p>

    <h3><a name="4"></a>Nov 16 - Nov 19 (5 posts): <a href="http://docs.FreeBSD.org/cgi/getmsg.cgi?fetch=101803+0+archive/2000/freebsd-advocacy/20001119.freebsd-advocacy">Good BSD press in feedmag</a></h3>

    <p><a href="mailto:des@ofug.org">[Dag-Erling Smorgrav</a> sent us a
      <a href="http://www.feedmag.com/essay/es405_master.html">url</a>
      with this quote:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><i>The underground's latest heroes are the directors of
	software projects based on 4.4BSD Lite, the free operating
	system pioneered at the University of California at Berkeley in
	the late 1970s.  The gratis software churned out by projects
	like FreeBSD and OpenBSD is in arguably superior to most
	mainstream Linux distributions, both in terms of security and
	portability.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>However, I declined to follow the link due to the bad reviews
      that followed as replies.  You decide for yourself.</p>
