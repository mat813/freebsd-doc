    <p>This started out with a poorly composed letter of complaint, Cc'd
      to us from a representative of Freedom Technologies Corporation, a
      company that builds pre-installed FreeBSD systems.  He seemed upset
      over a URL on the Intel web site that doesn't load for anything but
      IE, and used this is a plug to sell his services.  A couple of
      replies quickly let him know we didn't like that sort of thing.</p>

    <p>A continuation of <a href="05.html#2">last week's thread</a>, here
      we have a couple examples of what people are coming up with:</p>

    <p>This discussion is also continued on from <a href="05.html#3">last
      week</a>.  Some interesting additions to the conversation were:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><i>Some games have bugs that have audible manifestations on
	FreeBSD but not on Linux, probably because FreeBSD follows the
	spec instead of emulating OSS or Linux bug for bug</i> - <a

    <p><a href="mailto:keichii@iteration.net">[Michael Wu]</a> sends us a
      couple specific examples of how FreeBSD is used as either a teaching
      aid or a research platform by educational institutions.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.csie.nctu.edu.tw/os">National Chiao Tung
	University</A> - The Department of Computer Science and
	Information Engineering at this university in Taiwan uses FreeBSD
	to teach OS Arch.  An estimated 10-15% of *.edu.tw workstations
	are running FreeBSD, with a major following in the dorms as well.</li>

      <li><a href="http://ece.utexas.edu">University of Texas at Austin</a> 
	- As a teaching assistant, Michael himself uses FreeBSD as a
	supplement his classes.  The Professor uses C++, Codewarrior/x86,
	and he has decided to withhold opinion on that.</li>

      <li><a href="http://physics.purdue.edu">Purdue</a> - runs FreeBSD
	in their computer labs, according to <a
	href="mailto:will@FreeBSD.org">Will Andrews]</a>.</li>

      <li><a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/engineering/infotech/ITP%20499%20Unix%20System%20Administration.htm">University
	of Southern California</a> - has a course on FreeBSD System
	Administration, but <a href="mailto:kris@FreeBSD.org">[Kris
	Kennaway]</a> isn't sure on how often its offered.  "The Complete
	FreeBSD" by Greg Lehey is required material.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><a href="mailto:asmodai@wxs.nl">[Jeroen Ruigrok van der Werven]</a>
      wanted to clue us in on a book he recently purchased.  It seems
      that Warren W. Gay has written a book called "Advanced UNIX
      Programming" that uses FreeBSD 3.4-RELEASE throughout the entire
      book to test examples.  Warren also supports and mentions FreeBSD a
      lot.  If you'd like to take a look at his book, I found it at <a
      href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/067231990X/o/qid=974177545/sr=8-2/ref=aps_sr_b_1_2/105-8987692-0849559">Amazon</a>.
      The ISBN number is 0-672-31990-X.</p>.

    <p>Another thread stretched into its 2nd week, Terry & Jordan are still
      discussing an alternative to /stand/sysinstall.  A couple of
      interesting tidbits:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><i>It would be nice if the project would publish a roadmap
	indicating what it wants from developers, so that they don't end
	up spending an incredible amount of effort, only to find themselves
	stonewalled later.  If the project would at least publish an
	architectural roadmap for even only six months ahead, I think it
	would help to commit more people to expending the necessary effort
	to see to those goals.</i></p>

      <p><i>Clearly, the SMPng work is one goal that's pretty widely
	known, thanks to Jason Evans and others publishing their
	direction; if the project could be that forthcoming in other
	areas, then there would be a "guarantee" that, even if the work was
	ultimately rejected, at least you could know that you were
	travelling in the right direction, instead of getting to your
	goal, only to have the project say "that's nice, but that's not
	where we are headed".  At least put up some street signs".</i>
	- <a href="mailto:terry@lambert.org">[Terry Lambert]</a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p><i>Roadmaps are produced by people with the time and energy to
	write roadmaps.  One of the reasons SMPng is going so well is
	that we paid to fly a bunch of people to a kick-off meeting and
	get them working more cohesively together and then we continued
	to pay the manager of the project to do it on a full-time basis.
	Management is pretty important where the generation and
	implementation of roadmap documents is concerned and it's as hard
	to get it done on a purely volunteer basis as it is to get
	companies to pay for it in all the areas it needs done.</i></p>

      <p><i>I'd love to see more management and more roadmaps but I've
	also learned to live with the fact that there will never be as
	much of either as I or most anyone else would like.</i> - <a

    <p>This conspectus expresses my understanding of what occurred on the
      FreeBSD-advocacy mailing list during the specified week.</p>

    <p>Hey, I'm human... I may have made an error or two... If you think
      this is the case, and/or that I have omitted some significant thread
      or part of a thread, feel free to contact me via email.</p>
