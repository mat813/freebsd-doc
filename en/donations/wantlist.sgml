    <p>This page lists various developer hardware needs.  If you are
      interested in supporting the FreeBSD Project, you might consider
      donating some piece of hardware on this list to the Project.</p>

    <p>We provide the FreeBSD username of the developer who needs a
      resource, the country they are in (for shipping purposes), the
      equipment they desire, and the use to which that equipment will
      be put.</p>

    <p>For information on tax deductions and process, please see the
      information on the main <a href="index.html#donating">FreeBSD
      Donation Liason office</a> page.</p>

    <p>If you would like to donate something on this list, please
      contact donations@FreeBSD.org.</p>

    <p>On a more general note, we have need of a variety of Sparc 64
      machines for testing our new Sparc port.  Even small, old (or
      new!) Sparc 64 machines are perfectly usable.  No matter which
      country you're in, we almost certainly have someone local who
      could use it.  We could specifically use 1U rack-mounted Sparcs
      (such as E220R, E420R, Fire V100, Fire V120, or Netra T1 AC200)
      for our development and package-building clusters in the
      USA.</p>
