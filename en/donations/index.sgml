    <h2>Project Goal</h2>

    <p>As FreeBSD's userbase has grown, the number of people who want
      to donate materials or funds to the Project has grown.  The
      Donations Liason is intended to streamline the handling of these
      donations, and to ensure that they are handled in a timely and
      reasonable manner.</p>

    <p>More information will be available as soon as the fledgling
      Donations Team works out a process.  While the Donations Liason
      Officer has some definite ideas on how things should be done,
      these ideas should be sanity-checked by a slightly larger group
      before being given to the world.</p>
