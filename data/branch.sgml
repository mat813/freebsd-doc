<em>From <a href="mailto:jkh@FreeBSD.org">jkh</a>, November 4th:</em>

<p>FreeBSD's development stream has, as of today, branched into the
<b>2.2-RELEASE</b> and <b>3.0-<a href="handbook/current.html">CURRENT</a></b>
development streams.  The <b>2.1-<a href="handbook/stable.html">STABLE</a></b>
branch is also still alive, soon to terminate (for real, this time)
with the impending release of <b>FreeBSD-2.1.6</b>.</p>

<p>This branch has occurred so that <b>2.2</b> may be readied for release
without impacting significant new developments, like SMP support, in the
mainstream <a href="handbook/current.html">-current</a> branch.

<p>Modulo any of our usual two-week slips here and there, here is
our release schedule for 96/97:</p>

    <h3>December 1996</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>FreeBSD 2.1.6-RELEASE</b>
      <p>End of <b>2.1-STABLE</b> branch.</p>
    </ul>
    <h3>February 1997</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>FreeBSD 2.2-RELEASE</b>
      <p>Beginning of <b>2.2-STABLE</b>.</p>
    </ul>
    <h3>Spring 1997</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>FreeBSD 2.2.x-RELEASE</b>
      <p>Bugfix release for <b>2.2R</b> along <b>2.2-STABLE</b> branch.</p>
    </ul>

<p>This is also probably as good a time as any to announce that new
XFree86 <a href="ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/XFree86/3.2/binaries">
3.2 binaries</a>, with early <a href="http://www.matrox.com">Matrox</a>
support, are available.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.xfree86.org">The XFree86 project</a>
for the timely release, which will be distributed with <b>2.2-RELEASE</b>
and <b>2.1.6-RELEASE</b>.

<p>Lest there be any confusion about the <b>2.1.6</b> and <b>2.2</b> releases
coming so close together, let me also just explain that the two branches of
development had really very little to do with one another, and the fact
that both branches came to release status around the same time was
simply how the scheduling worked out.  When engineering is allowed
to do the scheduling, it rarely employs traditional marketing
stratagems. :)</p>

<p>In summary:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>2.1.6-RELEASE</b> is aimed squarely at commercial users who do not need
to be on the leading edge of development but favor things like stability
and a long test-cycle instead.  2.1-<a href="handbook/stable.html">STABLE</a>
 has had only incremental refinements made to it since <b>2.1.5</b> was
released, and <b>2.1.6</b> will end what we feel to have been a very
successful branch.<p></p>

<li><b>2.2-RELEASE</b> will begin introducing the more leading edge
technologies we have been developing over the year that
<a href="handbook/stable.html">-stable</a> has run in parallel,
and will also be entering bug-fix mode after its release.  Existing
-stable customers will be encouraged to make the jump to 2.2-STABLE
some time after <b>2.2</b>'s release, once the first round of customer
PRs have come back and been acted on.<p></p>

<li><b>3.0-CURRENT</b> is now the bleeding edge of development, and where
all new development takes place.  Until code freeze on the 10th
of November, changes may also be marked "For 2.2-RELEASE" and
they will be brought into that branch as necessary.  After code
freeze, it will have to be a clearly important bug fix to make
it in before the release date.<p></p>

Many significant changes are planned for <b>3.0</b>, and those interested
in its development should subscribe to the freebsd-current
<a href="handbook/eresources.html">mailing list</a> (send mail to
<a href="mailto:majordomo@FreeBSD.ORG">majordomo@FreeBSD.ORG</a>).
</ul>

<p>As always, <em>all</em> branches of FreeBSD development are available
from a single CVS repository which may be freely replicated
to your own machine (see <a href="handbook/handbook.html">the handbook</a>) or
<a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi">browsed</a> via
the WEB.

<p>Please do not hesitate to use this valuable resource!</p>

of <a href="http://www.cdrom.com/">Walnut Creek CDROM</a>, you will receive
both <b>2.1.6</b> and <b>2.2</b> releases.  Making each release a full CD
distribution was the only way of ensuring that each would meet the quality
expectations of each customer base, and any customer who feels they would
