<H1>Experience the possibilities with FreeBSD</H1>

<blockquote>
<P>FreeBSD can handle nearly any task you'd expect of a UNIX workstation,
as well as many you might not expect:</P>
</blockquote>

<HR ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE WIDTH="100%"><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE="+1">FreeBSD
is a true open system with full source code.</FONT></FONT>

<blockquote>
<P>There's no doubt that so-called open systems are <I>the</I> requirement
for today's computing applications. But no commercial vendor-supplied solution
is more open than one which includes full source code to the entire operating
system, including the kernel plus all of the system daemons, programs,
and utilities. You can modify any part of FreeBSD to suit your personal,
organizational, or corporate needs.</P>

<P>With its generous <A HREF="&base/license.html">licensing
policy</A>, you can use FreeBSD as the basis for any number of free <I>or
commercial </I>applications.</P>
</blockquote>

<HR ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE WIDTH="100%"><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE="+1">FreeBSD&nbsp;runs
thousands of applications.</FONT></FONT>

<blockquote>
<P>Because FreeBSD is based on 4.4BSD, an industry-standard version of
UNIX, it's easy to compile and run programs. FreeBSD also includes an extensive
<A HREF="&base/where.html">packages collection </A>and
<A HREF="&base/ports/index.html">ports collection</A> that bring
precompiled and easy-to-build software right to your desktop or enterprise
server. There's also a growing number of <A HREF="&base/commercial.html">commercial
applications</A> written for FreeBSD.</P>

<P>Here are some examples of the environments in which FreeBSD is used:</P>

<ul>
<LI><B>Internet services. </B>Many Internet Service Providers (ISPs) find
FreeBSD ideal, running WWW, Usenet news, FTP, Email, and other services.
Ready-to-run software like the <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</A>
web server or the Wu-ftpd FTP&nbsp;server make it easy to set up a business
or community-centered ISP. Of course, with FreeBSD's unbeatable <A HREF="&base/internet.html">networking</A>,
your users will enjoy high speed, reliable services.</LI>

<LI><B>X Windows workstation. </B>From an inexpensive X terminal to an
advanced X display, FreeBSD works quite well. Free X software (<A HREF="http://www.xfree86.org/">XFree86</A>)
comes with the system. <A HREF="http://www.xinside.com/">X Inside</A> offers
accelerated X software for high-performance graphics hardware (such as
Matrox), as well as the industry standard Motif and OpenGL libraries.</LI>

<LI><B>Networking. </B>From packet filtering to routing to name service,
FreeBSD can turn any PC into a Internet firewall, email host, print server,
PC/NFS server, and more.</LI>

<LI><B>Software development.</B> A suite of development tools comes with
FreeBSD, including the GNU C/C++ compiler and debugger and the Perl scripting
language. Java and Tcl/Tk development are also possible. Popular editors
like Xemacs and more esoteric programming languages like Icon work just
fine, too. And FreeBSD's shared libraries have always been easy to make
and use.</LI>

<LI><B>Net surfing.</B> A real UNIX workstation makes a great Internet
surfboard, and the BSD version of <A HREF="http://home.netscape.com/comprod/products/navigator/index.html">Netscape
Navigator </A>with Java support runs on FreeBSD. Surf the web, publish
your own web pages, read Usenet news, and send and receive email with a
FreeBSD system on your desktop.</LI>

<LI><B>Education and research.</B> &nbsp;FreeBSD makes an excellent research
platform because it includes complete source code. Students and researchers
of operating systems or other computer science fields can benefit greatly
from such an open and well-documented system.</LI>

<LI><B>And much more. </B>Accounting, action games, MIS&nbsp;databases,
scientific visualization, video conferencing, Internet relay chat (IRC),
home automation, multiuser dungeons, bulletin board systems, image scanning,
and more are all real uses for FreeBSD today. If you have an innovative
application for FreeBSD, <A HREF="&base/cgi/gallery.cgi">let us know</A>
so we can add it to our <A HREF="&base/gallery.html">gallery</A>.</LI>

operating system that will grow with your needs.</FONT></FONT>

<blockquote>
<P>Though FreeBSD is free software, it's also <I>user supported </I>software.
Any questions you have can be posted to hundreds of FreeBSD developers and
users simply by e-mailing to the
<A HREF="mailto:questions@freebsd.org">questions@freebsd.org</A> mailing
list.</P>

<P>FreeBSD also has a worldwide group of programmers and writers who fix
bugs, add new features and document the system. Support for new devices
or special features is an almost constant development process, and the
team keeps a special eye out for problems which effect system stability.
FreeBSD users are quite proud of not only how fast but how reliable their
systems are.</P>

of amazing. Salutations to the FreeBSD team.''</I></P>
