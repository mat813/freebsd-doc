<H1>FreeBSD offers many advanced features.</H1>

<blockquote>
<P>No matter what the application, you want your system's resources performing
at their full potential. FreeBSD's advanced features enable you to do just
that.</P>

<HR ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE WIDTH="100%"><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE="+1">A
complete operating system based on 4.4BSD.</FONT></FONT>

<blockquote>
<P>FreeBSD's distinguished roots derive from the latest <b>BSD</b>
software releases from the Computer Systems Research Group at the
University of California, Berkeley.  The book <I>The Design and Implementation
of 4.4BSD Operating System</I>, written by the 4.4BSD system architects,
thus describes much of FreeBSD's core functionality in detail.</P>

<P>Drawing on the skills and experience of a diverse and world-wide group of
volunteer developers, the FreeBSD Project has worked to extend the 
feature set of the 4.4BSD operating system in many ways, striving constantly
to make each new release of the OS more stable, faster and containing new
functionality driven by user requests.</P>

<HR ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE WIDTH="100%"><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE="+1">FreeBSD
provides higher performance, less system administration and compatibility
with other operating systems.</FONT></FONT>

<blockquote>
<P>FreeBSD's developers attacked some of the more difficult problems in
operating systems design to give you these advanced features:</P>

<ul>
<LI><B>Bounce buffering </B>gets around a limitation in the PC's ISA architecture
that limits direct-memory access to the first 16 megabytes.<P><I>Result:
</I>systems with more than 16 megabytes operate more efficiently with DMA
peripherals on the ISA bus.</LI>

<LI><B>A merged virtual memory and filesystem buffer cache</B>
continuously tunes the amount of memory used for programs and the disk
cache.<P><I>Result: </I>programs receive both excellent memory management
and high performance disk access,
and the system administrator is freed from the task of tuning cache sizes.</LI>

<LI><B>Compatibility modules </B>enable programs for other operating systems
to run on FreeBSD, including programs for Linux, SCO, NetBSD, and BSDI.
<P><I>Result:</I>&nbsp;users won't have to recompile programs already compiled
for one of the compatible OS's, and will have access to a greater selection
of off-the-shelf software, like the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/FrontPage/">Microsoft FrontPage Server</a>
extensions for BSDI or
<a href="http://www.corel.com/products/unix/wpunix/index.htm">WordPerfect</a>
for SCO.</LI>

<LI><B>Dynamically loadable kernel modules</B> allows new filesystem types,
networking protocols or binary emulators to be added to the kernel at
runtime without having to generate a new kernel image. <P><I>Result: </I>
Much time can be saved and 3rd party vendors can deliver complete subsystems
as kernel modules without having to distribute source or have lengthy
installation procedures.</LI>

<LI><B>Shared libraries </B>reduce the size of programs, saving disk space
and memory. FreeBSD uses an advanced shared library scheme which offers
many of the advantages of ELF, and the current version offers ELF compatibility
for both Linux and native FreeBSD programs.</LI>
</ul>

<P>Naturally, since FreeBSD is an ongoing effort, you can expect newer
features and higher levels of stability with each release.</P>
</blockquote>

<H2>What experts have to say . . .</H2>

<blockquote>
<P>`<I>`FreeBSD has an outline-structured visual configuration editor ...
you can enter the configuration of every device the OS supports and can
therefore get a successful installation on the first try almost every time.
IBM, Microsoft, and others would do well to emulate FreeBSD's approach.''</I></P>
