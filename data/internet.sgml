<H1>FreeBSD was designed for the Internet</H1>

<blockquote><P>FreeBSD includes what many consider the <I>reference</I> implementation
for TCP/IP software, the 4.4 BSD TCP/IP protocol stack, thereby making it
ideal for network applications and the Internet.</P></blockquote>

<HR ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE WIDTH="100%"><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE="+1">FreeBSD
supports standard TCP/IP protocols.</FONT></FONT>

<blockquote>
<P>Like most UNIX systems, the FreeBSD operating system enables you to</P>

<UL>
<LI>Share filesystems with NFS</LI>

<LI>Distribute network information with NIS</LI>

<LI>Support remote logins</LI>

<LI>Do remote SNMP configuration and management</LI>

<LI>Serve files with FTP</LI>

<LI>Resolve Internet hostnames with DNS/BIND</LI>

<LI>Route packets between multiple interfaces, including PPP and SLIP lines</LI>

<LI>Use IP Multicast services (the MBONE)</LI>
</ul>

<P>FreeBSD lets you to turn a PC&nbsp;into a World Wide Web server or Usenet
news relay with included software.  Using the included SAMBA software you
can even share filesystems or printers with your Win95 and NT machines and,
with the supplied PCNFS authentication daemon, you can support machines
running PC/NFS.  FreeBSD also supports Appletalk and Novell client/server
networking (using an <a href="http://www.netcon.com/">optional commercial
package</a>), making it a true "Intranet" networking solution.
</P>

<P>FreeBSD also handles TCP extensions like the <A HREF="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/htbin/rfc/rfc1323.html">RFC-1323</A>
high performance extension and <A HREF="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/htbin/rfc/rfc1644.html">RFC-1644</A>
extension for transactions, plus SLIP and dial-on-demand PPP. It's an operating
system suitable for a home-based net surfer as well as a corporate systems
administrator.</P>

networking is stable and fast.</FONT></FONT>

<blockquote>
<P>If you need an Internet server platform that is reliable and resistant
to crashes under heavy load, then consider FreeBSD. Here are just a few
of the companies that make use of FreeBSD every day:</P>

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.cdrom.com/">Walnut Creek CD-ROM</A> outside of
San Francisco runs one of the most popular <A HREF="ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/">FTP&nbsp;server</A>s
on the net, one that supports 1200 simultaneous connections. Their server
is a single FreeBSD machine, transfering over 2 terabytes (yes that's
<I>terabytes</I>!) worth of files every month.</LI>

<LI><A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Inc.</A> runs the ultimate index
of the Internet, serving scads of daily net surfers with information about
the World Wide Web. Yahoo, as well the companies that advertise on Yahoo,
rely on FreeBSD to run reliable and responsive web servers.</LI>

<LI>If that's not enough, visit our <A HREF="&base/gallery.html">Gallery</A>
of satisfied FreeBSD users.</LI>
</ul>

<P>FreeBSD makes an ideal platform for these and other Internet services:</P>

<ul>
<LI>Company-wide or world-wide WWW service</LI>

<LI>Proxy WWW service</LI>

<LI>Anonymous FTP&nbsp;service</LI>

<LI>Enterprise file and print services</LI>
</ul>

<P>The FreeBSD <A HREF="&base/ports/index.html">ports collection</A>
contains ready-to-run software that makes it easy to set up your own Internet
server.</P>
</blockquote>

<HR ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE WIDTH="100%"><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE="+1">High
performance <em>and</em> security.</FONT></FONT>

<blockquote>
<P>The FreeBSD development team is as concerned about security as they
are about performance. FreeBSD includes kernel support for IP&nbsp;firewalling,
as well other services, such as IP proxy gateways. If you put your corporate
servers on the Internet, any 386 PC (or better) running FreeBSD can act as
a network firewall to protect them from outside attack.</P>

<P>Encryption software, secure shells, Kerberos, end-to-end encryption
and secure RPC facilities are also available (subject to export
restrictions).</P>

<P>Furthermore, the FreeBSD team is proactive in detecting and disseminating
security information and bug reports with a
<a href="mailto:security-officer@freebsd.org">security officer</a> and
ties to the Computer Emergency Response Team
(<A HREF="http://www.cert.org/">CERT</A>).</P>
</blockquote>

<H2>What experts have to say . . .</H2>

<blockquote>
<P><I>``FreeBSD ... provides what is probably the most robust and capable
TCP/IP stack in existence ...''</I></P>
