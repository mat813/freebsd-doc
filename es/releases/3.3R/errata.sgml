---- Security Advisories:

Current active security advisories for 3.3:     None

---- System Update Information:

<strong>The fvwm desktop choice in the X Desktops menu doesn't work.</strong>
                                                                              
Fix: Install fvwm from /usr/ports/x11-wm/fvwm2 instead of using the
     desktop menu item and put "fvwm" in your $HOME/.xinitrc and
     $HOME/.xsession files for use by startx/xdm.  You can also build
     and reinstall /usr/src/release/sysinstall from 3.3-STABLE sources
     to fix the X Desktop menu item in question.

<strong>The lo0 (loop-back) device is not configured on startup, causing
utilities like mountd to fail.</strong>

Fix: Assuming that you experience this problem at all, edit /etc/rc.conf
     and search for where the network_interfaces variable is set.  In
     its value, change the word "auto" to "lo0" since the auto keyword
     doesn't bring the loop-back device up properly, for reasons yet to
     be adequately determined.  Since your other interface(s) will already
     be set in the network_interfaces variable after initial installation,
     it's reasonable to simply s/auto/lo0/ in rc.conf and move on.
